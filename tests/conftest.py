    Aaron Perry: Welcome to the YonEarth Community Podcast. Today we're talking about regenerative agriculture.
    
    Test Guest: Thank you for having me, Aaron. I'm excited to share about soil health and regenerative practices.
    
    Aaron Perry: Let's start with the basics. What is regenerative agriculture?
    
    Test Guest: Regenerative agriculture focuses on rebuilding soil health through practices like cover cropping, 
    rotational grazing, and reducing tillage. It's about working with natural systems.
    
    Aaron Perry: That's fascinating. How does this differ from conventional farming?
    
    Test Guest: Conventional farming often depletes soil over time, while regenerative practices actually 
    improve soil health, increase carbon sequestration, and support biodiversity.
