      "FORWARD\nI hail from the verdant landscape of Europe\u2019s eastern Alpine region, where my people have lived\nfor centuries in what is today known as Slovenia. Our land of glorious mountains, mysterious\ncaverns, glimmering lakes, rolling hillocks and dancing meadows has been a cultural crossroads\nfor millennia, and has in many ways remained a veritable Eden through the ages. In times of both\npeace and times of war, through epochs of great cultural upheaval as well as quiet interludes, my\npeople have dwelled and thrived, nestled between the shores of the Adriatic Sea, the craggy Alps,\nand the great, fertile plains rolling down and away to the East.\nMy people love the land. We love the sea. We love the trees. And, we love the soil. It is, perhaps\nabove all else, our connection with the soil that has preserved our countryside and that has allowed\nmy people to flourish with a form of liberty that only exists through close connection to the living\nsoil. In my culture, we have a deep tradition of family farming\u2014virtually every family, from the\nyoungest of children to the eldest of great grandparents. We connect to our soil within the loving\ncontext of family and within the steady rhythms of regular, day-to-day life. Gardening the soil\nconnects us directly with the elements, the weather, and the continuous cycling of the seasons.\nGardening the soil connects us literally and deeply to the living planet.\nThis Soil Stewardship Handbook is deceptively small and simple. For it is chock full of some of the\nmost salient insights and a form of humble inspiration that are essential to these times in which we\nlive. The book before you is a road-map of sorts, a guide, and a compass that will help set you on\na path to great well-being and set us all on a path to regeneration, stewardship and sustainability\non our Living Earth\u2014Gaia.\nWe humans are now at a great crossroads, one characterized by immense complexity and intense\nchallenges on mind-boggling scales. Challenges like rampant ecological devastation, staggering\nspecies loss, and climate change. But at this crossroads, we also find that the way through and out\nof these challenges include some of the simplest, most delightful, and most life-enhancing practices\nand habits we humans get to choose to enjoy here on Earth. In a world of seeming complexity, we\nwill find that hardly anything is as complex as the living web of interconnectedness found in our\nplanet\u2019s soil\u2014trillions upon trillions of living creatures in each handful, interacting in beautifully\nsophisticated ecologies."

Roosevelt\nOver the past century we have been waging an\nall-out war on soil. Since the advent of modern\nwarfare and chemical agriculture, we have been\nconducting a scorched-earth assault of global\nproportions on soil. Many of our poisonous\nchemical \u201cinputs\u201d used in this soil-destroying\n\u201cagriculture\u201d were developed by ammunition\nmanufacturers during WWI and WWII. (Can\nyou believe we would call this \u201cconventional\nagriculture\u201d?). Though extremely lucrative\nto the shareholders of these manufacturing\ncompanies, the planet-wide use of these poisons\nhas led to utter devastation: severe soil loss and\nmassive extermination of soil life. This deliberate\npoisoning of land also poisons water and air, as\nwell as our own bodies\u2014especially through the consumption of contaminated food, the drinking\nof contaminated water and the breathing of contaminated air.\nAs a society, we have become soil-destroyers. And our destruction of soil now presents an existential\nthreat to us all\u2014old, young, black, brown, white, conservative, moderate and liberal\u2014every single\none of us. Living in a time when we have decimated and destroyed the life-force in soils all over the\nplanet, it is critical that we understand this simple truth . . . and act on it. When considering what\u2019s\ngood for soil, and what foods are good to eat, perhaps we should simply conclude that if a person\nhas to wear a hazardous materials (hazmat) suit while spraying chemicals on the plants and soil,\nwe shouldn\u2019t be feeding ourselves or our\nfamilies these foods! When assessing\nand debating emerging agricultural\ntechnologies and techniques, we\nshould always ask ourselves: are they\nhelping us build living, healthy soil?\nAre they being deployed with an ethos\nof stewardship, care and caution to\nadvance the natural microbiology and\nmicroecology of the soil upon which\nwe and future generations depend for\nour very lives?

      "SOIL STEWARDSHIP HANDBOOK 9\nSOIL-BUILDING EXPLAINED: PRACTICAL\nAND AWESOME!\nBut what does it mean, exactly, to build soil? Soil building is a natural process, a continuous\ncycle that has been in motion for hundreds of millions of years on Earth. Because we humans\nhave destroyed so much soil, and have emitted so much fossil carbon into the atmosphere, it is\nimperative that we collaborate with nature in order to accelerate the natural soil building cycle,\nheal our environment, and reverse climate change.\nCOMPOST TEA is an aqueous soil amendment\nTh e soil-building process is one of the most complex\nand foliar spray made by \u201csteeping\u201d fi nished\nprocesses on Earth.

Th e good news, however\u2014essential\nnews\u2014is that we don\u2019t have to totally understand the\nmechanisms in order to be expert soil builders, working WORM CASTINGS are the excrement of earth-\nworms. Over 1 million worms may exist in one\nalongside Mother Nature. Th e key is the micro-biome:\nacre of healthy soil, producing 700 pounds of\nthe trillions upon trillions of tiny, living bacteria and\nenzyme-rich castings per day. They are a very\nfungus that interact with plant roots, worms, nematodes\nnutrient rich organic soil amendment.\nand other tiny animals, atmosphere, water, and minerals\nin a beautiful soil-building orchestra. Our job is to help\nthem in their work. Th is means to provide exceptional\nhabitat, nourishment and substrate (substances like BOKASHI is a traditional Japanese probiotic\nbiochar, compost tea, bokashi and worm castings), and liquid soil amendment made from in-vessel\nanaerobic fermentation of organic fruit and\nto make and spread compost\u2014essentially amplifying the\ngrain waste.\nwork of the micro-biome.\nAs the soil microbiome magically does its soil-building work, it not only enhances plant growth\n(which itself sequesters atmospheric carbon\u2014locking it up in the wood of tree trunks and other\nbiomass), it also collaborates with the plants to put carbon into the soil substrate in their root zones.\nTh is is the amazing, mysterious, sacred soil-building process upon which all of our lives depend,\nand upon which the sustainable future of our species and civilization now depends entirely. We\nare on the edge of a very precarious cliff \u2014some would say we\u2019ve already gone over the cliff \u2014but\nthere\u2019s the possibility of a great safety rope here. An incredible safety net that we can deploy and\nutilize by building soil in humble collaboration with Mother Nature.\nTime is of the essence\u2014and we\u2019re all needed in this great, world-wide endeavor.\nAre you ready to join and be a powerful participant in one of the greatest movements ever\nexperienced?\nAre you ready to build soil?"

      "\u201cY on Earth is a needed read not only for Millennials but for all who want to survive\u2014\nboth personally and globally. The current unsustainable consumption of time, goods\nand the Earth\u2019s collapsing resources threatens us all. Y on Earth is a pleasant, easy\nread that assesses the systemic problems that face humanity, while offering insights\nand approaches to reconnect to soil, to each other and to ourselves.\u201d\n\u2014Hunter Lovins, author, Climate Capitalism\nand founder, Natural Capitalism Solutions\n\u201cY on Earth presents bridges of knowledge and wisdom over which we can travel from\nworldviews of scarcity, degradation and injustice towards celebrating and protecting\nthe abundance of God\u2019s Divine Creation. It is an inspiration for humanizing our\nlives, and for becoming more neighborly, more purposeful, more humble and more\nprincipled in our homes and economies.\u201d\n\u2014James Featherby, Chair, Church of England,\nEthical Investment Advisory Board and author, Of Markets and Men\n\u201cY on Earth is a timely and compelling guide to living and loving in our evermore\ncomplex and rapidly changing world. Comprehensive in its scope, it deals with almost\nall aspects of what it means to be a human. It explores our relationship to the earth,\nto other people, to our vocations, to our spirituality, to technology, to culture, and to\nour search for meaning in the 21st century. It is well worth reading!\u201d\n\u2014Dr. Ralph Sorenson, Director, Whole Foods Inc.,\nand President Emeritus, Babson College\n\u201cIn a world full of abundance, it is interesting that we feel more disconnected, discontent\nand dis-eased than ever. In the deep thinking that is at the core of Y on Earth, Aaron\nprovides a way of thinking about connectedness, contentment and ease in a manner\nthat is both refreshing and accessible. Simply reading the chapter titles has the power\nto change perspective and reconnects us to the notion of choice . . . in how we live in\ncommunity, family, work and this world. Our very survival could depend on living\neffortlessly in the midst of abundance and complexity. This is a fabulous read that\nmust be contemplated and shared among our many connections.\u201d\n\u2014Jandel Allen-Davis, MD"
