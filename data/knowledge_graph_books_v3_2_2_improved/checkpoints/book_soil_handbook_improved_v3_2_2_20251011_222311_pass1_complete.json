      "FORWARD\nI hail from the verdant landscape of Europe\u2019s eastern Alpine region, where my people have lived\nfor centuries in what is today known as Slovenia. Our land of glorious mountains, mysterious\ncaverns, glimmering lakes, rolling hillocks and dancing meadows has been a cultural crossroads\nfor millennia, and has in many ways remained a veritable Eden through the ages. In times of both\npeace and times of war, through epochs of great cultural upheaval as well as quiet interludes, my\npeople have dwelled and thrived, nestled between the shores of the Adriatic Sea, the craggy Alps,\nand the great, fertile plains rolling down and away to the East.\nMy people love the land. We love the sea. We love the trees. And, we love the soil. It is, perhaps\nabove all else, our connection with the soil that has preserved our countryside and that has allowed\nmy people to flourish with a form of liberty that only exists through close connection to the living\nsoil. In my culture, we have a deep tradition of family farming\u2014virtually every family, from the\nyoungest of children to the eldest of great grandparents. We connect to our soil within the loving\ncontext of family and within the steady rhythms of regular, day-to-day life. Gardening the soil\nconnects us directly with the elements, the weather, and the continuous cycling of the seasons.\nGardening the soil connects us literally and deeply to the living planet.\nThis Soil Stewardship Handbook is deceptively small and simple. For it is chock full of some of the\nmost salient insights and a form of humble inspiration that are essential to these times in which we\nlive. The book before you is a road-map of sorts, a guide, and a compass that will help set you on\na path to great well-being and set us all on a path to regeneration, stewardship and sustainability\non our Living Earth\u2014Gaia.\nWe humans are now at a great crossroads, one characterized by immense complexity and intense\nchallenges on mind-boggling scales. Challenges like rampant ecological devastation, staggering\nspecies loss, and climate change. But at this crossroads, we also find that the way through and out\nof these challenges include some of the simplest, most delightful, and most life-enhancing practices\nand habits we humans get to choose to enjoy here on Earth. In a world of seeming complexity, we\nwill find that hardly anything is as complex as the living web of interconnectedness found in our\nplanet\u2019s soil\u2014trillions upon trillions of living creatures in each handful, interacting in beautifully\nsophisticated ecologies."

Respect and reverence will surely follow\u2014which are necessary to take good care\nof this wonderful place upon which all of our lives depend.\nI hope you\u2019ll roll up your sleeves, dive deeply into this Soil Stewardship Handbook, and dig deeply\ninto the hidden memories of peace and abundance lying asleep within your body and soul. For\nyou will find that, like my people in Slovenia, we are all living descendants of peoples who have\nlong and beautiful traditions of connectedness to the land. We have to. For we are human, and\nbeing connected to land and soil is what it means to be human.\nAnd now through our power of choice, we each get to choose to create the future by incorporating\nancient wisdom into our modern lifeways.

Roosevelt\nOver the past century we have been waging an\nall-out war on soil. Since the advent of modern\nwarfare and chemical agriculture, we have been\nconducting a scorched-earth assault of global\nproportions on soil. Many of our poisonous\nchemical \u201cinputs\u201d used in this soil-destroying\n\u201cagriculture\u201d were developed by ammunition\nmanufacturers during WWI and WWII. (Can\nyou believe we would call this \u201cconventional\nagriculture\u201d?). Though extremely lucrative\nto the shareholders of these manufacturing\ncompanies, the planet-wide use of these poisons\nhas led to utter devastation: severe soil loss and\nmassive extermination of soil life. This deliberate\npoisoning of land also poisons water and air, as\nwell as our own bodies\u2014especially through the consumption of contaminated food, the drinking\nof contaminated water and the breathing of contaminated air.\nAs a society, we have become soil-destroyers. And our destruction of soil now presents an existential\nthreat to us all\u2014old, young, black, brown, white, conservative, moderate and liberal\u2014every single\none of us. Living in a time when we have decimated and destroyed the life-force in soils all over the\nplanet, it is critical that we understand this simple truth . . . and act on it. When considering what\u2019s\ngood for soil, and what foods are good to eat, perhaps we should simply conclude that if a person\nhas to wear a hazardous materials (hazmat) suit while spraying chemicals on the plants and soil,\nwe shouldn\u2019t be feeding ourselves or our\nfamilies these foods! When assessing\nand debating emerging agricultural\ntechnologies and techniques, we\nshould always ask ourselves: are they\nhelping us build living, healthy soil?\nAre they being deployed with an ethos\nof stewardship, care and caution to\nadvance the natural microbiology and\nmicroecology of the soil upon which\nwe and future generations depend for\nour very lives?

Many of our ancient traditions speak of\nthe elements: earth, air, fire and water. Where\nelse do we have the opportunity to physically\ntouch and hold all of these elements working\ntogether? In a handful of living soil, we find\nthe earth minerals, moistened and enlivened\nwith water, billions of organisms breathing\nthe air in and out, and the fire of sunlight\u2014\nof energy\u2014flowing throughout these small,\nmagical communities. The four elements are\nfound in balance in healthy living soil. But\nthere\u2019s more. Our alchemical traditions speak\nof a fifth element\u2014the quintessence\u2014which\nrepresents our loving relationship with this soil. This quintessence is a spiritual cultivation of our\nwillful intention and deliberate action to serve as stewards, to help regenerate and heal, and to\nmaintain an ongoing commitment to care and sustainability. The fifth element is made manifest\nand amplified by us humans. It is at the core of our sacred stewardship mission.\nWhat a miraculous, regenerative, life-giving and healing process we each have the ability to\nengage in! This is something we can do at virtually any age\u2014from the youngest of children and\ngrandchildren to elders at all stages of aging. This is our birthright, and it is essential to our survival.\nLet us engage in the alchemy of life on Earth and build soil together!\nFire Air\nWater Earth"

Although\nthe ocean contains far more carbon than even terrestrial soil, the increased loading of\ncarbon in the ocean causes acidification, making that aqueous environment dangerously\ntoxic to marine life. It is through soil-building that we will reduce atmospheric carbon and\nrelieve acidification pressure in the ocean. Interesting to note, the lithosphere\u2014with rocks\nlike calcium carbonate\u2014contains at least 75,000,000 billion tons of carbon!\n3 Visit www.yonearth.world to find biochar, wormcastings compost tea, bokashi and\nbiodynamic soil preparation resources!\n4 Visit www.fungiperfecti.com to get garden giant spawn to plant in your garden!"

      "\u201cY on Earth is a needed read not only for Millennials but for all who want to survive\u2014\nboth personally and globally. The current unsustainable consumption of time, goods\nand the Earth\u2019s collapsing resources threatens us all. Y on Earth is a pleasant, easy\nread that assesses the systemic problems that face humanity, while offering insights\nand approaches to reconnect to soil, to each other and to ourselves.\u201d\n\u2014Hunter Lovins, author, Climate Capitalism\nand founder, Natural Capitalism Solutions\n\u201cY on Earth presents bridges of knowledge and wisdom over which we can travel from\nworldviews of scarcity, degradation and injustice towards celebrating and protecting\nthe abundance of God\u2019s Divine Creation. It is an inspiration for humanizing our\nlives, and for becoming more neighborly, more purposeful, more humble and more\nprincipled in our homes and economies.\u201d\n\u2014James Featherby, Chair, Church of England,\nEthical Investment Advisory Board and author, Of Markets and Men\n\u201cY on Earth is a timely and compelling guide to living and loving in our evermore\ncomplex and rapidly changing world. Comprehensive in its scope, it deals with almost\nall aspects of what it means to be a human. It explores our relationship to the earth,\nto other people, to our vocations, to our spirituality, to technology, to culture, and to\nour search for meaning in the 21st century. It is well worth reading!\u201d\n\u2014Dr. Ralph Sorenson, Director, Whole Foods Inc.,\nand President Emeritus, Babson College\n\u201cIn a world full of abundance, it is interesting that we feel more disconnected, discontent\nand dis-eased than ever. In the deep thinking that is at the core of Y on Earth, Aaron\nprovides a way of thinking about connectedness, contentment and ease in a manner\nthat is both refreshing and accessible. Simply reading the chapter titles has the power\nto change perspective and reconnects us to the notion of choice . . . in how we live in\ncommunity, family, work and this world. Our very survival could depend on living\neffortlessly in the midst of abundance and complexity. This is a fabulous read that\nmust be contemplated and shared among our many connections.\u201d\n\u2014Jandel Allen-Davis, MD"
