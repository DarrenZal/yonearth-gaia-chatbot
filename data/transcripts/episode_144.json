I\u2019m your host, Aaron William Perry. And today we\u2019re visiting with Vicki Hird, the author of re-bugging the planet. Hi Vicki.\n\nHi, good to be here. It\u2019s great to visit with you and what we\u2019re going to be talking about today is obviously one of the most important topics for our entire global community and planetary situation. So I\u2019m really, really excited we have this opportunity to visit with you.\n\nIt\u2019s great to be here. I have been so pleased with the reactions to the reports and people\u2019s interest in it. So it\u2019s great to be speaking about it.\n\nWonderful. And I think for fun, we\u2019ll maybe refer to this episode as our creepy crawly episode.\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t put noses in there because they\u2019re not nasty.\n\nNot at all. No, we\u2019d love it. Maybe we love it creepy code. Yes.\n\nVicki herd is head of the sustainable farming campaign for sustain the alliance for better food and farming. And she also runs an independent consultancy and experienced an award-winning environmental campaigner researcher writer and strategist working mainly in the food farming and environmental policy arenas.\n\nVicki has worked on government policy for many years and is also the author of perfectly safe to eat the facts on food.\n\nVicki\u2019s passion is insects. The first pets she gave her children were a family of stick insects and she had a giraffe necked weevil tattoo for her 50th birthday.\n\nVicki also has a master\u2019s degree in pest management and she is a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and Vicki as you and I were just discussing before we began to record.\n\nToday is your first day. Congratulations on a new job as a strategic leader on agriculture at the wildlife trust. So that\u2019s wonderful. Congratulations.\n\nThank you. Yeah. Been a busy busy day, but it\u2019s good to be there.\n\nI\u2019m so sure and yeah, thanks for taking the time on day one to visit with us and really excited to dive into this and and to kick things off.\n\nI\u2019m just going to ask you a very open question. Like why why bugs? Why does it matter? What are we talking about?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s such a critical part of our ecosystem, part of our lives. And one of the reasons I wrote the book was because I don\u2019t think enough people recognize that or realize that.\n\nAlthough I think that\u2019s changing. One of the reasons also that I wrote the book because I think people are beginning to be interested.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot more wildlife programs that cover invertebrates. There\u2019s been books. There\u2019s been like citizen science where people get involved.\n\nAnd I think we need to tap into that and understand what it means for people in terms of their lives, their politics, their consumption.\n\nSo I wrote the book with that in mind, but also with the idea of making bugs their role and their brilliance and their beauty a bit clearer.\n\nSo as a paperback, it\u2019s not, you know, it\u2019s not a huge tone with loads of pictures, but there\u2019s a lot out there on the invertebrates.\n\nBut I just wanted to sort of distill it in one book with loads and loads of tips for what you can do as well, which was key for me at the campaigner.\n\nI always want to communicate what you can do. But they\u2019re also in trouble. That\u2019s the other reason.\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. And we\u2019ll be talking about that. And just, you know, those of our audience who are watching the video version of our discussion.\n\nThis is a copy of the book. This is actually a galley advanced copy.\n\nAnd yeah, the cover is so beautiful with all of this.\n\nIt is nice, isn\u2019t it? Yeah. The diversity there. And it\u2019s not just insects. That\u2019s the important thing. Insects are critical.\n\nBut all the other invertebrates, the species without a spine in our rivers, in our seas, on our land, in our soil.\n\nThey\u2019re everywhere, almost everywhere. And they\u2019re really critical. And combining them with the fungi, we certainly won\u2019t be here without them.\n\nAbsolutely. Can you give us the bad news? Where are we in terms of what\u2019s happening with the invertebrates right now?\n\nYeah. There\u2019s some really scary long-term trend studies, which shows over decades how the number of species and diversity of species has been declining.\n\nWhere they\u2019ve been actually looking. And that\u2019s not everywhere. So there\u2019s a big gap in the data, a big gap in the research, which I think scientists globally are beginning to fill.\n\nYou know, in the last five years, there\u2019s been a massive scientific recognition of the problem. So they\u2019re starting to look how we can fill that.\n\nIt\u2019s probably enough just within the side. You know, one of the things we\u2019ve been researching on invertebrates for the past 200 years is how to kill them.\n\nHow to get rid of them? How to zap them? And now, you know, there\u2019s a lot more money and research going into how to protect them, how to avoid destroying their habitats and their lives.\n\nSo that\u2019s really exciting. But it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s gaps. But what we\u2019ve seen is the combination of factors. There isn\u2019t one single thing.\n\nBut we know that several different factors have been creating this big long-term decline in many species and many critical species.\n\nBut also species that we love, you know, butterflies and mayflies and all sorts that we actually love because of how beautiful they are.\n\nBut also they feed other things that we think are beautiful like birds. And obviously they have critical functions in our food system.\n\nBut climate change, habitat loss, losing their habitat. And I\u2019d have it being fragmented, which means they\u2019re really isolated.\n\nThey\u2019re doing well in one patch, but they can\u2019t get to the next patch to mate, to recolonize, to feed, to have a refuge.\n\nThey haven\u2019t got that corridor. Those fragmentation are really, really problematic, particularly in farmed land and land, which has been heavily degraded through usually farming.\n\nBut other reasons as well, like mining and development and encroachment from cities and towns.\n\nSo those two are biggies, but also pollution. Pollution coming from pesticides, fertilizers, manure, particularly in river and marine environments, which have so many invertebrates in them, critical invertebrates.\n\nAnd so that pollution, but it\u2019s also things like plastic pollution and noise pollution.\n\nAnd so these biggies, you know, climate change is a critical one because they\u2019re such small animals.\n\nTheir surface to volume ratio is very high, so they can lose heat and lose walks very quickly.\n\nSo they can be particularly badly impacted when you\u2019ve got extremes that they weren\u2019t predicting.\n\nAt the same time, insects and invertebrates can adapt. They\u2019re known as radar tool.\n\nThey produce millions of offspring every year, many of them. So they can adapt.\n\nBut if we change it so fast, as we are with the climate change, and have attack loss and pollution incidents, then it\u2019s very difficult for them.\n\nAnd they just crash. They don\u2019t thrive and they don\u2019t move around as they should.\n\nAnd so that\u2019s one of the things that we can all do something about, having gardens, having green spaces.\n\nYeah, absolutely. You know, and as as you and I previously discussed, we had a Scott Zershi on the podcast series,\n\nthe executive director of the Earth, excuse me, Scott Black, the director of the Zershi society.\n\nAnd in that discussion, we were talking about the what looks like potentially the sixth great extinction.\n\nYeah, very scary, very scary.\n\nI\u2019ve heard some pretty staggering figures around biodiversity and biomass reductions.\n\nAnd he mentioned in Germany, a study showing something like 75% decrease in flying insect biomass.\n\nThat was a big one. Yeah, that was one that triggered a lot of media interest. Yeah, it was scary.\n\nWhat\u2019s your what\u2019s your read? What\u2019s your take on where we\u2019re at worldwide in terms of some of these percent changes?\n\nWell, they are beginning to sort of do collective analyses of all the studies and suggestions that 40% are at risk of going extinct.\n\nAnd some of these will be ones that we haven\u2019t even discovered yet.\n\nYou know, there\u2019s invertebrates even around us that we haven\u2019t discovered yet in these soils.\n\nBut in places in the global south in South America, there\u2019s millions probably that we don\u2019t know about.\n\nSo it\u2019s hard to say, but there are 40% has drawn from a lot of studies that we\u2019re potentially seeing massive extensions.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the sort of problem that you get when you get sort of extensional crashes locally.\n\nI mean, locally it could be in a nation or in a region.\n\nAnd, you know, we talk about foods and, you know, we love foods. It is chocolates and coffee.\n\nThey rely on a very tiny fly to be pollinated.\n\nAnd if you lose that fly for other reasons, for deforestation, for pollution, mining elsewhere,\n\nyou\u2019re not going to get the chocolate and you\u2019re not going to get the coffee.\n\nSo it\u2019s things like that.\n\nAnd it is quite scary when you look at the figures about deforestation and removal of wetlands, critical wetlands in places.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve done a lot of damage already in, I live in the UK, in North America.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a lot of clearance already, but you do have your wilderness areas, which are amazing.\n\nRefuges and all wilderness areas are much smaller.\n\nBut we\u2019re trying, but there are some really serious alarm bells ringing that we\u2019ve got to all act on.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Well, wait a minute.\n\nSo it\u2019s one species of fly that pollens chocolate worldwide.\n\nIt\u2019s a tiny, tiny fly.\n\nI think there\u2019s probably different species worldwide that have learned how to do it.\n\nBut from where chocolate originally came from, which I think might be Asia, but I might be wrong about that.\n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s tiny.\n\nAnd so, you know, you can\u2019t have another kind of species doing it, because they\u2019ll be too big,\n\nor their wings will be too long, or they won\u2019t have the right mouth parts.\n\nYou know, these evolution of relationships between bugs and plants have been over millennia.\n\nAnd you know, you can\u2019t recreate them that easily.\n\nHowever, adaptable invertebrates are.\n\nBut what we\u2019re trying to do, in some plots of the world, where they\u2019ve lost their pollinators, like in China,\n\nthey\u2019re actually doing hand pollination.\n\nAnd they\u2019re developing robotic bees.\n\nI talk about that in the book, actually.\n\nI think it\u2019s hilarious.\n\nYou know, the millions that will be spent, and the resources, like metals, that will be used in creating robotic bees.\n\nWhen we\u2019ve got something on tap that is free, replicates itself, does the best job,\n\nand gets right to the heart of the flower.\n\nYou know, we should be protecting the bees, and the other pollinators,\n\nabsolutely without fail, rather than investing billions in robotic bees.\n\nOr spending millions in hand pollination.\n\nIs suitable in some circumstances, when you want to do things differently.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a solution to world hunger without pollinators.\n\nOh, my gosh.\n\nYou know, this reminds me of an episode we recently did with Tom Chi,\n\nwho has a company called At One Ventures.\n\nAnd he\u2019s tracking all kinds of emerging regenerative technologies.\n\nAnd he was talking about, in the energy industry,\n\nthere was a multi-billion-dollar carbon sequestration plant that was funded by one of the big oil and gas companies\n\nthat sequestered or has the potential to sequester the same amount of carbon\n\nas something like approximately 137 beavers.\n\nBeavers, right? Animals that do their things are free.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t have depreciation.\n\nWe don\u2019t have machinery that\u2019s wearing out over time.\n\nAnd so\u2026\n\nA lot of cement probably involved in that.\n\nLots of cement, which is unbelievably bad for climate.\n\nSo, yeah, if and as we\u2019re getting more intelligent and harmonized\n\nwith the natural brilliance genius of all these different species and their roles,\n\nI think they\u2019re going to do so much more in the way of restoration and regeneration\n\nthan probably, you know, many more technology.\n\nLots of say we shouldn\u2019t do anything.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYeah. But there is actually billion spent on that,\n\nwhich could be used to really reinforce the existing systems,\n\nthe natural systems that can do it so well, like forests and woods and beavers,\n\nas you say, they\u2019re amazing keystone species.\n\nBut so wood ants, you know, making sure the wood ants can survive.\n\nThey provide an environment in woods, for instance, up in Scotland,\n\nwhich provide a really balanced environment of pest predators and pathogens\n\nand herbivores, making sure that the forest survives well.\n\nWhen you take them out, the forest declines and you get over abundance of pest species.\n\nSo those keystone species exist in the invertebrate world,\n\nas well as the mammalian.\n\nYeah. I mean, carbon capture and storage, which is possibly what was being referred to there,\n\nthe carbon. You know, it\u2019s still untried.\n\nIt\u2019s still untested at scale.\n\nAnd they\u2019re pouring millions into it, subsidies.\n\nOur taxpayers\u2019 money is going into that.\n\nSo it\u2019s really, it strikes me as interesting what you mentioned about the wild open spaces\n\nhere in the United States versus the smaller versions in the UK.\n\nI\u2019m curious from a land use perspective,\n\nwhat would your policy recommendations be in a place like the UK given?\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nHow do patterns have already been deployed?\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got a very dense population in the UK.\n\nYou know, we haven\u2019t got as much land as you have to have wilderness areas\n\nthat are genuinely left to rewild themselves and maintain themselves\n\nto a strong degree.\n\nBut what we\u2019ve done with our natural spaces,\n\nand our natural parks, our parks that are supposed to be protected,\n\nis not particularly well.\n\nI mean, seriously not.\n\nAnd you use them in ways which many think are deeply unsustainable\n\nand certainly don\u2019t retain a nature and wildlife that we need to provide that refuge for those species.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot of campaigns to reinforce the rewilding approach to natural environmental, natural areas.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s a whole spectrum.\n\nLike if you\u2019re going to farm in those natural parks and nature parks,\n\nwhich we tend to have to because we\u2019ve got a very large population that needs feeding\n\nand we don\u2019t want to throw food from elsewhere too much,\n\nto do it in ways which protect nature.\n\nAnd you can do that.\n\nYou can do nature-based farming with a lot of really great habitat for,\n\nand rotations in the farm system,\n\nwhich can actually retain a really good population, diverse population of invertebrates,\n\nwhich will also help you when you farm, you know,\n\nlike that pest predators, you know,\n\nthey\u2019re brilliant at doing what they do in a farm situation.\n\nBut actually introducing that into systems which have been farming cheap for a long time,\n\nor intensive cereals, et cetera,\n\nit takes a lot to change the culture and the habits,\n\nand also the supply chains and the buyers.\n\nSo it\u2019s a complex picture we weave if we\u2019re going to try and do more wilderness areas in the UK.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of opposition, there\u2019s a lot of pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a hot topic here in the UK.\n\nBut that\u2019s why I mentioned it.\n\nYou\u2019ve had your wilderness for many years created by politicians and maintained,\n\nwhich we can be envious of,\n\nbut we don\u2019t necessarily have the opportunity to completely recreate.\n\nPerhaps a shout out to Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nAbsolutely, yeah, he\u2019s a bit of a call.\n\nBut we have, you know, we have done things here.\n\nWe have green belts, we have natural parks,\n\nbut they are under a huge amount of pressure.\n\nAmazing.\n\nWell, I want to be sure that we\u2019re talking about the invertebrates in soil and water,\n\nbut before going there, the flying ones,\n\nthe ones perhaps many of us might think of more immediately.\n\nYou know, I drive through the Midwest,\n\nso regularity.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve really noticed these past few years that we get far fewer bugs on the windshield\n\nthan we did last driving there as a kid.\n\nAnd around here, lately in Colorado,\n\nI\u2019ve been actually thrilled to see more bugs on the windshield\n\nas perhaps morbid as that might sound or counterintuitive as that might sound.\n\nWhat it essentially implies is that the populations are stronger, right?\n\nStronger, absolutely.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny.\n\nThat was the subtitle of the book originally.\n\nWhen I recently put it to Chelsea Green,\n\nit was so great in accepting it.\n\nThey said, maybe the young people won\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about when you say\n\nand how to get the bugs back on your windshield,\n\nbecause we haven\u2019t had them for so long in the UK.\n\nUnless you\u2019re in an amazing organic farm or one of the good parks,\n\nit\u2019s very rare to get bugs on your windshield.\n\nBut funny enough, we have a bug life,\n\nwhich is a conservation organisation for invertebrates.\n\nThey do a splatter campaign every year,\n\nand they get people to print out a splatter test\n\nfor their cars.\n\nAnd then you drive for a while,\n\nand then you send it in the results.\n\nAnd it\u2019s citizen science with the splatter test.\n\nBut I think, you know, that\u2019s an indicator if you\u2019re getting more in Colorado.\n\nThat\u2019s really great.\n\nBut I think the intensification of our farming systems,\n\nthe neatness of it, the chemicals,\n\nthe reduction in edges and woodlands,\n\nall massive factors in that, you know,\n\nthe invertebrates just have got a chance.\n\nWow, I love hearing about the citizen science work.\n\nWe did something here for organizations,\n\nand the city of Boulder,\n\nwith different organics, soil amendments,\n\nand people who are testing for carbon sequestration\n\nand wildlife.\n\nOh, great.\n\nReally a lot of fun to participate in that.\n\nThat\u2019s cool to hear about.\n\nWe\u2019re actually starting to talk here about people getting money off their water bills\n\nif they have soil in their gardens,\n\nbecause people are starting to, you know,\n\ntoo much concrete or tiling or even worse,\n\nplastic grass.\n\nYou know, they\u2019re terrible in all sorts of ways,\n\nbut they really don\u2019t absorb the water.\n\nSo you get, you know, potential flooding and things like that.\n\nSo it\u2019s an interesting fiscal measures\n\nthat could help drive people towards that.\n\nAnd more carbon, knowing that they\u2019ve got more carbon,\n\nwe\u2019re exciting people, I would have thought.\n\nSo that\u2019s really clever of Boulder.\n\nOh, that\u2019s amazing.\n\nHow far along is that after that?\n\nNot very far as far as I know.\n\nI saw a headline.\n\nI thought I was very excited about it.\n\nWe need to push it.\n\nWe need to push those things.\n\nYou know, getting those nudge things\n\nthat can help people make decisions differently.\n\nAlthough I think we should ban plastic lawns.\n\nSorry, that\u2019s it.\n\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get that,\n\nbut you know, there\u2019s all sorts of things people can do.\n\nEven if they\u2019ve got concrete,\n\nthey can put pots, do a lot.\n\nYou know, if they can\u2019t get rid of the concrete,\n\nthey can do an awful lot for the bugs.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhat are some of the techniques\n\nif folks have a lot of concrete they\u2019re dealing with?\n\nYeah, well, we\u2019ve got actually Chelsea Green\n\nwho published a brilliant book by a guy\n\nand I\u2019ve forgotten his name right now,\n\nbut I can share it with you.\n\nHe\u2019s done that balcony gardener\n\nor something like that.\n\nHe\u2019s got brilliant ways of producing amazing abundance\n\nin pots, in planters,\n\nand even on a balcony you can produce a lot of food\n\nand a lot of flowers for the pollinators.\n\nAnd that book\u2019s got loads of ideas\n\nand there\u2019s a lot on the internet as well\n\nabout how you can raise a lot of plants\n\nin diversity and diversity is key to protecting the bugs.\n\nSo if you have a garden with mostly concrete,\n\nyou can put a huge amount of plantas,\n\nyou know, raised beds with soil,\n\nso you get the soil bugs as well,\n\nand healthy soil gives you healthy food.\n\nBut even if you can\u2019t be raised beds,\n\nyou can do a lot of pots.\n\nYou know, if you\u2019ve got a small yard,\n\nyou could have 50 pots all producing different things\n\nand flowers at different times a year.\n\nAnd having that year-round flowering\n\ncould be really important for the invertebrates\n\nin terms of a refuge, food source,\n\nnest thing, areas.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot you can,\n\neverybody can do something.\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nI\u2019ll do something.\n\nI love this.\n\nAnd I\u2019m starting to envision slogan,\n\nsave the chocolate fly.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nPlant it, plant it.\n\nPlant something in a garden, save the chocolate fly.",
