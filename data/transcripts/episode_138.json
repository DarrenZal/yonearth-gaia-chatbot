  "description": "In our current epoch, what Tom calls “Epoch 0,” our global economic activity is primarily extractive, and has embedded in it a dangerously destructive logic: “to run the economy, we must destroy the ecology.” In the next epoch (Epoch One), our economic activity will be “materially productive” instead of extractive, Tom asserts. Then in the subsequent epoch (Epoch Two), the global economy will be primarily focused around enriching ecosystem metabolics. Finally, in the most advanced economic epoch (Epoch Three), Tom predicts that we’ll be maximizing diverse nutrient flows and “savoring” each solar photon and each water molecule – all within the logical rubric of global commercial activity. These Epochs are discussed in further detail in the “State of the Planet” talk that Tom gave at a recent At One Ventures annual general meeting of shareholders. Tom has shared a Vimeo link to this talk – available in the show notes.",

  "full_transcript": "[10.5s - 16.0s]: Welcome to the Why On Earth Community Podcast. I'm your host, Aaron William Perry.\n\n[17.0s - 23.4s]: And today we're visiting for a second time with technologist and financier Tom Chi-Hai-Tom.\n\n[24.0s - 25.9s]: How are you today?\n\n[27.0s - 28.0s]: Pretty good.\n\n[28.4s - 33.0s]: I'm really looking forward to our conversation and we've got a lot to cover, obviously.\n\n[34.4s - 35.2s]: Absolutely.\n\n[36.4s - 50.9s]: Tom Chi is the founder of At One Ventures, which has already deployed over $100 million into several companies working on regeneration stewardship and sustainability technologies.\n\n[51.9s - 73.2s]: Some of these companies include Iron Oaks, which is robotic agriculture, Dendra Systems, which is drone tree planting, true, which is advanced air conditioning, wild earth, sustainable pet products, apes core 3D printed low carbon geopolymer cement and robotic masonry, and several others.\n\n[73.2s - 84.2s]: And is in the middle now of a second fund, which is looking to deploy somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million in the coming months and quarters.\n\n[84.8s - 96.2s]: And we're so excited, Tom, to see the progress with all that you're doing with these important technologies and to hear that the first fund has gone so well.\n\n[96.2s - 116.3s]: And just in case some of our audience don't know just to give a little more on your background, you know, Tom went to Cornell University and prior to launching at One Ventures did a number of technology projects and products with companies like Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo Search, Google, etc.\n\n[116.3s - 138.0s]: And was involved in the Google Glass and Google self driving car development efforts. And so we're going to we're going to have a lot of talk about today, including some specific technology, some of the view you have into the phases of our economic development relative to sustainability technologies will chat a little bit about AI even.\n\n[138.0s - 150.5s]: And to kick things off, Tom, I just thought I'd ask you openly, you know, how are things at At One Ventures and what's happening that's got you excited at this time.\n\n[151.7s - 165.8s]: Yeah, things are going very well. We as you mentioned, we raised 150 million fund one and we did 27 investments in that fund and that fund is off to kind of a flying start, you know, relative to.\n\n[167.2s - 192.3s]: Peers that started in the same year around the same size were in the top 2% and not just for a climate, but for across all types of funds and all types of sectors. So yeah, just outperforming the market by quite a bit on that front and we are mostly done raising a 300 million dollar fund to, though that is open until, you know, toward the end of July.\n\n[193.9s - 222.2s]: Wonderful. And I imagine you're already eyeing a number of investment opportunities and probably it's not at this stage appropriate to talk about many of them or any of them in great detail, but I'm curious if you're seeing emerging trends in the technology as it relates to sustainability as it relates to ecology restoration as it relates to climate change mitigation. Are you seeing anything that's emerged in the last several months since you launched fund one.\n\n[223.6s - 238.5s]: Well, to be clear, we started fund one, you know, over three years ago at this point. So there's a lot that we saw and a lot of it's well represented in the portfolio of 27 for fund to we did our first close and fund to last summer.\n\n[238.5s - 259.3s]: So we've already had some time with fund to but you basically open up the fundraising window for a little bit. So, you know, there's some time for folks to come in. So we are actually already have eight investments in fund to including, for example, the first vaccine to protect honey bees ever created and also now USDA approved as of December of 22.\n\n[261.0s - 273.0s]: Oh, wow, that's interesting. Yeah, there we know call the collapse disorder has been one of the greatest threats to our global food supply. I imagine you could speak to some of the facts and figures on that.\n\n[274.5s - 282.6s]: Absolutely. And call any collapse disorder is basically a a rough way that people had been kind of describing the output of things.\n\n[282.6s - 301.8s]: Now, sometimes it was related to things like, you know, American foul brood European foul brood, which is the types of diseases that this vaccine protects against because those tend to be the types of diseases where the whole high fails at once as opposed to, you know, things that hit individual bees but may not be as damaging to an entire high.\n\n[301.8s - 314.7s]: But if I want to go help characterize the major stressors for bees, there's there's three major stressors. One of them is Neonicototoid pesticides, which are widely used all throughout North America.\n\n[315.3s - 326.0s]: They're kind of ostensibly banned in Europe, but there's a lot of, you know, agriculture that is grandfathered in where they continue to use it at pretty large scales effectively everywhere in the world.\n\n[326.0s - 336.6s]: Another one is a type of parasite called the vera destructor might, which like, you know, if you were to scale it up to a human size, it'd be like the size of a dinner plate on a human.\n\n[337.1s - 343.1s]: That's like what, you know, like a 12 inch dinner plate on a human, like that's how big it is compared to a bee proportionally.\n\n[343.1s - 353.4s]: And, you know, a bee can like live with one a might, but if it ends up with two, three mites, then it's kind of a metabolic drag at a level that it really weakens everything about the might.\n\n[353.9s - 361.4s]: And then the, sorry about the bee. And then the third category is these diseases, which is the stuff that the vaccines are meant to address.\n\n[362.7s - 377.6s]: Yeah, wow, that's great to hear. I've heard some many billions of dollars worth of food production in some significant portion of everything we consume as humans comes from the pollinated crops.\n\n[378.4s - 385.0s]: Yeah, so the majority of of biomass on the planet is actually angiosperms, which are flowering plants.\n\n[385.7s - 393.7s]: It's like 80%. And given that the role of pollinators, you know, just even beyond the basic food system is enormous.\n\n[394.4s - 409.0s]: And we have been both damaging the pollinators within our food system. And if folks really want to dive into this, the University of Maryland is has been running the kind of the industry benchmark reports in terms of annual be losses from the commercial perspective.\n\n[409.0s - 415.9s]: You can just search the words that would make sense given that sentence to be able to find it not too hard to find.\n\n[416.4s - 424.8s]: And you can kind of track the kind of losses that we've been having. I will short circuit it and say that we've been losing 40 to 50% of the commercial bees per year every single year.\n\n[425.1s - 433.8s]: So it is very dramatically impactable to the industry. This is not a thing where it's like a minor hit and they're just working around it easily.\n\n[433.8s - 447.0s]: This is a thing that is leading to a very bad situation because we have fewer and fewer bees, which means we need to split more hives in order to try to get more bees, which actually reduces the genetic diversity.\n\n[447.6s - 463.0s]: And then because we don't have enough bees, then we bring them all to a couple places, you know, North America, like most of the commercial bees in North America go to Southern California for the almond crop in January and February.\n\n[463.8s - 469.7s]: And the combination of reducing genetic diversity and then concentrating everybody in the same spot at the same time.\n\n[469.8s - 476.0s]: That's like a recipe for a total collapse. Anyway, put that aside for a second. That's just the commercial stuff.\n\n[476.3s - 492.5s]: And the larger picture of the 80% of biomass that is flowering plants, then it means that all these pollinators are out there, not just the honey bees, but there's all these pollinators that are out there that are critical to biodiversity on the planet.\n\n[493.8s - 508.9s]: And so that's the way that we've been doing agriculture and because of how widespread agricultural practices across the world, then we have been both killing the honey bees, which, you know, we obviously keep better stats on, but we are accidentally killing a bunch of pollinators.\n\n[509.9s - 518.4s]: And for, you know, if you follow the work of Charles Darwin, then you'll know about like the the moth with the 11 inch per viscous.\n\n[519.0s - 530.5s]: And he kind of theorized that this moth must exist because there's a plant with like a, you know, like a 10 or 11 inch like, you know, like depth that you would need to get to to be able to successfully pollinate it.\n\n[530.5s - 541.6s]: And actually a lot of life on earth is like that where there is literally only one pollinator or there might be a primary that does 90% of it in a secondary that does 10% of it.\n\n[542.1s - 555.4s]: And what has been happening is we have been accidentally extincting or massively impacting the populations of plants around the planet by hitting pollinators that weren't even what we're trying to hit with our pesticides.\n\n[555.4s - 578.1s]: Right, we were trying to go deal with some some specific agricultural pests in the field, not these pollinators, but we have been kind of hitting it across the board and it is both affecting, you know, the biodiversity of those pollinators, of course, directly, but also what they pollinate a bunch of species are starting to go extinct because we just killed all their pollinators.\n\n[579.6s - 594.1s]: Yeah, we did an episode a while back with Scott Black, the executive director of the Zercy Society that's doing so much to help educate and mobilize the public around these issues with pollinators and other invertebrates specifically.\n\n[595.1s - 616.1s]: And just recently was also interviewing a Chelsea Green author talking about wood ship in agricultural gardens and orchards and other settings in order to help rebalance the fungal to bacterial ratios in the soil ecosystems.\n\n[616.3s - 642.2s]: And similarly, the broad scale use of pesticides has severely disrupted underground we've got the pollinators and invertebrates above ground and then we've got this other set of ecosystem members below ground where we've essentially been systematically destroying the fungal species and have seen an increase in the bacterial species bringing the soil ecosystems out of balance as well.\n\n[642.2s - 656.7s]: And so this is an above and below kind of two pronged situation. It's so important that we're addressing right and I'm curious if you're doing any work with soil related regeneration at this point with your portfolios.\n\n[656.7s - 671.0s]: Yeah, actually one of our fun to companies is called Mira Terra and they basically have created the you know the most accurate way of being able to go measure the compounds that are in soil.\n\n[671.5s - 682.1s]: And the technology is such that you could do the stuff in field. You could you know measure everything and change your your treatment plan if you're a farmer within the same day.\n\n[682.3s - 693.6s]: As opposed to right now you would typically need to go around and take a bunch of soil samples a bunch of soil cores send them to a soil testing lab wait for weeks or months by the time the stuff gets back.\n\n[693.6s - 702.3s]: It's like other management practices has happened in between you've applied fertilizer you've applied you know herbicide you've applied different things that might actually change that profile.\n\n[702.8s - 708.7s]: So we've never been able to just like understand where the soil is right now and then be able to make smart management choices.\n\n[709.3s - 718.6s]: And because of that you know it's estimated that the application of the the most common inputs into agriculture are massively over applied right now.\n\n[718.6s - 736.3s]: And this is you know NPK nitrogen phosphorus potassium is kind of like the the classic like super trio and then depending on what you're growing then there will be different you know micronutrients and others that you will track because it's important for that crop type.\n\n[736.3s - 757.8s]: But NPK is pretty common across the board so something like this will would allow you to kind of go into the field understand NPK literally right there and be able to go you know adjust how you were applying things in the field immediately and and by our estimates it could move into the territory of doubling farm incomes.\n\n[758.8s - 784.4s]: Just given the nature of the current margins and the percentage of the cost structure that currently goes to over application and the other application helps nobody right if you put extra nitrogen on the field you're like oh maybe it stays fertile for the next year no it doesn't basically becomes nitrous oxide oxide emissions which is basically the third most you know prevalent greenhouse gas that we are producing at scale after carbon dioxide and methane.\n\n[785.5s - 803.6s]: So it helps nobody the farmer wasted money that could have been money in their pocket you know the environment is further hurt the soil is not improved in any way from it so to be able to go fix this fix multiple problems including the kind of runoff that leads to you to vacation downstream.\n\n[803.6s - 829.6s]: Yeah now there is one other one other like benefit and tweak to this is in the process of being able to like grab NPK the same instrument doesn't just get three things it can actually you know assess everything that it's trained for so we could train the thing to actually pick up hundreds of interesting compounds including all this micron nutrients but notably be able to go measure soil carbon directly.\n\n[829.6s - 859.5s]: And there's a lot of people that are out there it's like well if I fly the satellite and we're used synthetic aperture radar and we interpolate the points right then one can presume that the soil carbon levels bubble block and I would just tell you that it's really hard to pull that off you're just very far away from the thing you're trying to measure and a farmer walking their field just kind of pointing this instrument and a number of things you can get insanely more accurate and if you wanted to be able to do that.\n\n[860.4s - 871.4s]: So you know you can get a lot of things that are going to be able to get into the larger system of carbon markets that it's helpful to be able to just get very accurate measurements close up now besides the fact that.\n\n[871.4s - 893.7s]: That's you know it's been hard to measure in the past the other reason that carbon markets haven't been that interesting to farmers is you know your land might sequester you know one to three tons per year per acre right we just kind of put it in a reasonable range look it can do less than that for sure you know but certainly farmers have been able to get into that range.\n\n[893.7s - 914.1s]: And if that's the case if you look at the voluntary carbon markets right now maybe you're going to net yourself eight dollars ten dollars twelve dollars you know at the end of the year on an an acre that might top line a thousand dollars so you can understand why people don't completely change their management approaches to get eight more dollars on a thousand.\n\n[914.8s - 923.7s]: Now look their margins are way worse than that maybe they're take home from the thousand dollars is only sixty dollars but even then it's like do you change the management price.\n\n[923.7s - 949.3s]: So that's the fact is for everything and put yourself in kind of this unknown space in order to try to nudge things up by eight dollars it's not it's not that you know compelling to most farmers but if you actually have an instrument where they're going out there measuring MPK which is what they want to do anyway because you might save a hundred dollars on on fertilizer and inputs for hundred fifty dollars and you can this very material to your to your net profitability then.\n\n[950.8s - 979.3s]: Then then in the process of doing that you actually automatically got the carbon measurement then it just becomes a bonus on top of something that you were going to do anyway and the one last thing i'll say about this tech which i think is very very compelling is that unlike you know neutron back scatter or a bunch of these you know other kind of near and for red spectroscopy approaches which have a bunch of different limitations not only will we be able to go and and measure that carbon directly we're going to do that.\n\n[979.3s - 1007.7s]: We will be able to go tell the difference between you know short labile carbon long labile carbon and mineralized carbon and in these markets people have a a add a huge price premium for things that are kind of mineralized because we know that to stay in the in the soils and a pretty stable state for thousands of years sometimes tens of thousands of years right and then labile carbon short labile carbon might be in an organism and then back out in the atmosphere in five days.\n\n[1007.7s - 1037.7s]: You know long labile might be in there for you know five years ten years you know hundred years but you know it will come back out in a bit but to be able to understand the relative proportions and kind of teach farmers from that direct measurement to be able to manage things in a way that massively improve their profitability but also kind of creates that on ramp for a relationship to carbon markets it's it's very exciting on a bunch of fronts we we could not be more excited about that.\n\n[1041.8s - 1066.6s]: So that's so wonderful so that's myra tera and just for some of our audience that may not know the term beautification this is essentially when we overload in water environments the nutrient density we lead to essentially oxygen starved situations leading to major dead zones in many of our river\n\n[1068.1s - 1078.9s]: delta's worldwide and so this is a really significant issue where our major river systems meet the oceans of the world and I didn't catch it.\n\n[1078.9s - 1085.9s]: It is the highest form of water pollution in the in the world by volume and it has very substantial ecological effects.\n\n[1087.2s - 1093.8s]: Yeah yeah I didn't catch the name of the honeybee vaccine company if you mentioned it and want to share it.\n\n[1093.8s - 1097.2s]: That's called the Lan animal health EAL again.\n\n[1098.0s - 1098.4s]: Cool.\n\n[1101.3s - 1114.4s]: I want to be sure to share with our audience also Tom this wonderful talk that you gave at one of your annual general meetings and shared with me and with our\n\n[1114.4s - 1125.8s]: why on earth community state of the planet talk and we're going to make this available in the show notes and probably through the why on earth community blog page for folks to check it out themselves.\n\n[1126.7s - 1144.1s]: You know in this talk you mentioned several really interesting things about emerging technologies about some of the trends that you're tracking and one of the things specifically that struck me was your characterization of these four different epochs in our\n\n[1144.1s - 1158.1s]: economic development our technology development as it relates to things like ecosystem stewardship regeneration climate stabilization and so on which in the way you characterize these it begins with epoch zero.\n\n[1158.9s - 1162.8s]: Can you can you walk us through this framework and tell us a bit about this.\n\n[1163.8s - 1174.8s]: Yeah so you know I'm glad you'll be able to kind of post it for folks to see the full talk is full talks like an hour so there's no way that if you have a fit it in like a five minute answer or whatever.\n\n[1175.1s - 1189.0s]: But it's called the three epochs of ecological technology because there's three where you're actually trying to get better relative to the relationship of economy to ecology and then the zero one is the one we're in right now which is the fully extractive economy.\n\n[1189.0s - 1198.0s]: So epoch zero is the extractive economy and the gist of the extractive economy is that you know natural resources are understood to be commodities.\n\n[1198.7s - 1217.8s]: You know people achieve financial leverage by basically scaling extraction so if you can if the same equipment can cut down twice as many trees in a day then boom that scale guys that's how we get leverage and that economic indicators in that you know in that kind of framework which is remember the framework of today.\n\n[1217.8s - 1236.3s]: 10 to either be uncoupled but often more often antithetical to ecological goals so like on one hand you might look at that and you say like yeah yeah okay sure the same machine where like you know version 2.0 that machine can cut down twice as many trees per day yeah I make a lot more money like that it's a big economic win.\n\n[1236.3s - 1248.9s]: But you can see how that's like directly against you know the ecological health indicators so effectively like in this current epoch to run an economy we cannot help but destroy the ecology.\n\n[1249.8s - 1263.8s]: Now if you if you think about where we could be going instead of that because it's like well you know what are we even talking about you're just describing the world of days or any other thing you could do then the epoch beyond that is called the material productivity economy.\n\n[1263.8s - 1293.7s]: And the gist of material productivity is it asked a slightly different question it asks you know well first it recognizes that you know instead of resources just being commodities that resources you know natural resources are still commodities in this framework but that but with practical natural limits and we actually see a bunch of economic frameworks whether it's don't economics or whether it's you know that that were like the the different kind of analyses of like oh we're going to be able to do that.\n\n[1293.7s - 1322.7s]: So we're using three and a half earths of this resource that kind of thing that are basically trying to talk about the commodities with practical limits kind of things so all of that thinking fits in a material productivity epoch which by the way there's still two more epochs beyond that so you know but that said this is the epic which is closest to us and because of it it's the one that we can most practically work on today but getting to it if you understand that commodities have practical limits then what.\n\n[1322.9s - 1352.8s]: What it means to get better at a material productivity economy is you ask yourself the question well how do I get more financial leverage by more judicious and and effective use of the same amount of material or the same amount of energy so for example like if I go and take a handful of sand a handful of sand could be sold to the construction market for literally pennies right fraction of a penny for a handful of sand but the same amount of mass and a handful of.\n\n[1352.9s - 1382.8s]: Sand could be used to go make a hundred micro trips and that might you know that might get you back like five thousand dollars worth the top line revenue compared to you know if you're selling it to like a through sand and gravel situation to to to construction it might be one penny now that was the same amount of physical material we had to do different things to it but like we got more material productivity out of it this why it's called the material productivity epoch and the same.\n\n[1382.9s - 1409.2s]: So the same sort of question around materials can be asked around around energy so for each you know kilowatt or jewel or BTU you pick your favorite you know unit of energy then how do we get the most benefit whether it's economic benefit social benefit you know ecological benefit that's the question that the material productivity epoch asks of us.\n\n[1409.7s - 1427.4s]: Now like I said this is the one that's closest to us and most of the folks that talk about sustainability are talking about different variations of this epoch but you know in our work and if people spend time with the with the talk then you will hear that there's a couple epochs beyond this so so.\n\n[1428.8s - 1446.4s]: And the next epoch is kind of the first really big jump so epic to because everything until now it's like look natural resources are commodities we just got to be smarter with it you know we need to have an outer ring to the donut we need to have an inner ring to the donut hey right like we just got to be smarter about some of these things but\n\n[1446.4s - 1476.4s]: but about to is the first big jump and this is basically instead of understanding natural resources as commodities what if we understood you know the actual resource is healthy ecosystem metabolics so not nouns not the nouns of tonnage of wood extracted lumber extracted not the nouns of you know like tonnage of like mind or extracted which is the way that we think about I can.\n\n[1476.4s - 1506.4s]: Economic growth right now and resources right now but like thinking in turn and which are also nouns right those are basically just like this is a thing that I can sell you it's a noun if instead you have the big shift of starting to think about ecosystem metabolics you start to understand the resources the verb the watershed is a verb or a watershed to be healthy actually creates an enormous amount of economic value now we find out that it's a lot of normal.\n\n[1506.4s - 1524.0s]: It's an enormous amount of economic value when we mess it up right when we dam it or we mess up the poison the groundwater or or like you know put a bunch of fertilizer in there so it's unified and so on so forth right like we find out later that oh my gosh this was actually the resource.\n\n[1525.0s - 1553.8s]: Now what is a watershed a watershed is not a noun that I can like pick up and sell you like I can sell you like a couple tons of timber or where I can sell you a couple you know tons of a specific extracted or or even like a service right like a like a watershed is effectively only healthy if the verb is going right and you need to like get out of that mindset of like oh well what even happens on a market exchange a market exchange is basically selling nouns.\n\n[1554.0s - 1572.3s]: So this stock is a noun and it represents a company that does this type of extraction and that's a bunch of nouns and if you get out of that entire thinking if you get out of that line of thinking entirely and you start to understand we are only here because of a series of healthy you know ecological metabolic verbs.\n\n[1573.0s - 1602.3s]: And to the extent that we start to treat those verbs as actually the core of where economic you know wealth comes from then we will start treating the whole thing quite differently now there's been a bunch of like you know partial stabs at this so for example valuing nature based services as an example of that but in a way that's kind of taking the verb and trying to move it back into a noun frame and be like see like it's worth this as opposed to the or that you would have got was worth that right but the problem with that frame.\n\n[1602.3s - 1613.5s]: The same is you're not valuing the metabolic directly and because you're not valuing it directly we might discover a new type of or that is just more valuable than the ecosystem service and also it all explodes.\n\n[1614.4s - 1631.6s]: So like I'm not saying that people should not do that type of work i'm just saying that it has programmed in a type of fragility because the foundational thought process is still trading nouns in a market as opposed to the verbs are the source of all economic value and in a way they are sacred.\n\n[1632.4s - 1661.6s]: And actually the question of sacredness is a pretty deep one on this where you know it is often said we live in this market economy blah blah blah and I know we're going to talk a bit you know and we can talk about that next actually after I talk about the epochs about you know economy economics is a design discipline is opposed to a science but right now we live in this kind of market economy or we all kind of believe it in enough that we are going to talk about that.\n\n[1661.6s - 1674.3s]: That that's the current way that economics is designed and because of it like everything has a price which means even the damage in the world if you could make enough money at it you will be you will feel free to do it.\n\n[1674.9s - 1690.6s]: But I will put out there that we actually do have a type of economic classification that's outside of that we haven't used it very often but like it's really important that we we get more familiar with it and for lack of better term you know I call it kind of like.\n\n[1690.6s - 1707.1s]: The sacred you know fraction of things right and for example there are international laws against selling organs right because even the organs would have a market price and a person could live without a kid you right it's possible a lot of people do.\n\n[1707.8s - 1730.2s]: Then it would be a very dangerous world if you basically just had a price for all of that and people might use that to go exploit the poor and be like well you know you only make a ten dollars a day and your kidney would be worth this much right like you start to get into pretty gruesome things if you don't have a fraction of the world that is just considered to be sacred.\n\n[1730.2s - 1752.6s]: And I think everybody understands this like if you if you had just had you know your first kid and you're like you know walking down the street and the kids in the stroller whatever and they're six months old or something if somebody walked by and said how much you'd be like no this is not for sale I know we live in a market economy this is just off the table we're not even a little bit okay with that.\n\n[1752.6s - 1770.8s]: So like clearly every human mind understands this category we pretend not to understand this category when we participate in a market economy but I think we actually need to put some more things in this category including the sacredness of ecosystem metabolic as the source of all value creation in the economy.\n\n[1770.8s - 1800.8s]: And this is why I say epic to is actually a pretty big shift now if you get that done then where you get financial leverage is not from the machine that can extract stuff twice as fast the place where you get financial leverage is that a little bit of care in protecting or enriching the ecosystem metabolic leads to you know massively healthier ecosystem metabolic which creates way more wealth than the tiny bit of care that you put in the market.\n\n[1801.6s - 1819.2s]: And you think about all the folks that spend time on regenerative landscaping and agriculture right they'll spend a little bit of time with some earth moving in order to set up some squals like in order to go change the the you know moisture transport about the landscape and because of it they are encouraging healthier ecosystem metabolic.\n\n[1819.2s - 1849.0s]: Well that one time upfront cost could lead to major economic benefit you know year after year after year and actually the more that you make those verbs healthier then the more you know it actually unlike most mechanical things where the maintenance costs gets higher over time the in this case as the ecosystem gets healthier the maintenance costs gets lower over time so like the net productivity is higher the maintenance costs is lower and lower and in the crudest terms you can call this a form of financial leverage.\n\n[1849.2s - 1871.7s]: Because at the end of the day then a bunch of money people are going to need to understand this and they like to go here words like financial leverage and this is absolutely mapable into that into that framework but you need to first understand that the basic metabolic is sacred and then once you get into that then you can start saying like okay well hat what is most honoring of the sacred metabolic.\n\n[1871.7s - 1887.0s]: Like and what is the ways that we can work with manage you know be be in concert with these metabolic so that it gets way healthier because we're around as opposed to oh well we cut down this forest but the land can still take it.\n\n[1887.2s - 1901.6s]: Oh we dug out this or but the land can still take it we kill these pollinators but the land can still take it this is how we got into sustainability as a mindset where it's like we newer destructive so we're just like let's not destroy it more let's bring it up.\n\n[1901.6s - 1907.2s]: To that level of of a truce but to me it's like the truce is not stable.\n\n[1908.2s - 1921.4s]: The truce that you might come to you with a sustainability only mindset is like when somebody makes a sustainable business it's almost like you have gotten to this balance point where market tech and ecology are all just kind of in enough balance.\n\n[1922.0s - 1937.5s]: But but tech and and economy just keep on changing right so it's a very unstable truce so you you and your company might have gotten into a good spot in 1980 but then market and technology has changed by 1990 so you're thing that might have been actually\n\n[1937.5s - 1947.5s]: really sustainable back then then the truce is broken and you need to fix it again and the truce is broken you need to fix it again so this is why I think we need a bigger jump than that mine state.\n\n[1948.0s - 1956.5s]: You need to flip over to the other side where ecosystem metabolic are effectively sacred and then you start thinking about leverage in terms of verbs as opposed to nouns.\n\n[1957.2s - 1957.5s]: Yeah.\n\n[1957.9s - 1964.4s]: You know verbs on improving the health of that metabolism as opposed to nouns on intensity of extraction.\n\n[1964.4s - 1985.1s]: Let me interject with a quick question on this because I it's such a beautiful articulation of vision and hopefully where we're headed with epoch to and the way you just articulated it really compliments the way you did in this other video we're making available.\n\n[1985.1s - 2009.3s]: I have a question which is you're describing the the what in a really beautiful and profound way and I want to ask about the how so how do we mobilize capital into the behaviors and activities of epoch to in such a manner that there's a sufficient profit motive there that the investor class is typically looking for.\n\n[2009.9s - 2037.4s]: Yeah so you already mentioned one of the companies dendro systems and dendro systems does scalable ecosystem restoration and you know well who's in the market for that well our initial customers were these kind of mining companies where they need to do it for regulatory reasons but some of our more recent customers it's getting more and more interesting where we had done a pretty extensive restoration of main groves in southern Myanmar.\n\n[2037.4s - 2047.2s]: And what's the story behind it well basically those main grows initially were there but the Myanmar government actually cleared them for quote unquote economic development.\n\n[2047.5s - 2057.4s]: What actually happened in clearing them is they got rid of the source of subsistence fishing for a huge population in southern Myanmar and also they had starving people on their hands.\n\n[2058.1s - 2063.3s]: And they now needed to spend a huge amount in government services just to have the people not starve.\n\n[2063.9s - 2072.8s]: Now you look at something like that and you're like wow that's chaos right so so they basically can't just like you know actually it would be cheaper to just fix the ecosystem.\n\n[2073.0s - 2093.3s]: Then it would be for us to keep paying these these now now that's a government type situation and I think governments because of things are currently like externalized from industry are oftentimes going to be the folks that are actually first looking at doing some things in epoch to but it doesn't mean that you aren't creating very clear evidence.\n\n[2093.3s - 2102.9s]: So there's a lot of economic value as mentioned there another one is that same company is now looking at restoring over 20,000 hectares of main grows around the Abu Dhabi region.\n\n[2103.3s - 2107.6s]: And what you may or may not know about it is they cleared their main grows some decades ago as well.\n\n[2108.0s - 2112.2s]: And you know they and Abu Dhabi is developed quite a bit you know over those decades.\n\n[2112.7s - 2121.5s]: And because of it people want to have beachfront property and they want to be able to go to the shore but because they destroyed all these kind of natural erosion barriers.\n\n[2122.2s - 2130.5s]: Then they're needing to go out there and mind sand for literally billions of dollars in order to just dump them there and hope that it doesn't erode away which of course it does.\n\n[2130.5s - 2139.9s]: So you look at this is like well when it be way cheaper for you to actually fix this by spending 50 million dollars putting the ecosystem back in place.\n\n[2140.1s - 2148.3s]: Then it would be for you to spend billions of dollars trying to go and dredge sand and dump it in some other place that just erodes away.\n\n[2148.9s - 2154.7s]: And we have this all over the place in the barrier highlands along the eastern coast of North America.\n\n[2154.7s - 2163.9s]: It's just everywhere this type of you know quote unquote business is happening that is honestly once again just both ecological chaos and economic chaos.\n\n[2164.5s - 2182.8s]: Are you seeing the insurance and re insurance stakeholders as being interested in some of these strategies because obviously around coastal areas for example when we get severe storms there's tremendous property loss in many instances that would have been mitigated by healthy man grow ecosystems.\n\n[2183.6s - 2198.9s]: Yes so absolutely that's that is that is in the mix and actually specifically to the insurance question though this is not a main group project the nature conservancy created the first insurance policy for coral reefs.\n\n[2199.7s - 2208.1s]: And basically the way that it was in the first one launched in Katana Roo you know stayed in Mexico along the Gulf Coast and.\n\n[2208.1s - 2230.4s]: And the basically the way that it worked was look we know that if a storm does a direct hit against a populated area along the shore you know in the US it's like a 50 to 150 billion dollar cost a lot of that is born by insurance right some of it just goes to losses to property owners on that kind of thing but like a lot of it's born by insurance.\n\n[2230.4s - 2260.3s]: And because of this like the nature conservancy is been working with insurance companies and basically saying yo what if you know we could set up a type of insurance because we know that having a really healthy coral reef not too far from from the shore actually dramatically reduces wave energy because like coral reefs are almost kind of shaped like fractures there's almost and they're like really stuck on the ground as opposed to we tried to like you know do civil engineering where we like make these big concrete.\n\n[2260.3s - 2286.4s]: And we like drop them in the water and then it's like that's going to stay forever that thing like ways 20 tons and then you hop over there three years later and it's like 10 miles away from when you dropped it and it's like whoops now coral reef doesn't have that problem a coral reef is meant to be in the waves and it absorbs a huge amount of wave energy like 90% of that wave energy that might be coming from storms both because of it's truly anchored to the ground naturally and because of intrinsic and it's safe.\n\n[2287.0s - 2294.1s]: And given this the nature conservancy set it up where they said look can tell you if you get a cap three direct hit or above.\n\n[2294.8s - 2304.6s]: Then this insurance policy is going to pay out and it's going to pay out money to be able to restore that reef because your reef will be partially damaged in the process of kind of saving your town.\n\n[2305.0s - 2315.6s]: But like you would save so much more money by being able to have that healthy reef is opposed to needing to deal with 50 billion dollars of insurance payouts or damage on shore after a storm.\n\n[2316.2s - 2328.6s]: And that that policy actually successfully paid out you know five years ago it actually only took two years before a cap three or above storm hit there because hey welcome to welcome to the 21st century.\n\n[2329.0s - 2337.6s]: But but like now that that has happened then the nature conservancy is now looking at expanding that to like 20 to 25 more sites.\n\n[2338.2s - 2351.0s]: And something like that is now looking into well there could be a business around the restoration of those reefs in order to encourage a better metabolic relationship in this case with coastal hydrology right.\n\n[2351.8s - 2366.6s]: So one of the now this is not a portfolio company dendrous systems is a portfolio company but this is a project that I am working on you know directly because I helped to start it as the company called reef gen which basically is a coral planting robots and see.\n\n[2366.6s - 2388.9s]: Seagrass planting robots so they're basically robots that are designed to be able to work in near shore conditions which is quite challenging because you're in the surf zone and water has a lot of mass and wants to toss your robot around but I can get into a lot of the details on how to make a stable platform that can go do see grass and coral planting but you know as of today reef gen is the first.\n\n[2390.6s - 2411.4s]: It is it is the program that has created the robot that has done the first live planting of corals back into a reef and it is also the first that has done the first live planting of seagrasses back into seagrass nettoes and they're able to do it at a cost structure and a speed that human teams you know will not be able to match.\n\n[2411.4s - 2427.0s]: And this is effectively technology which is which is investible that is leaning into creating healthier metabolics and in the process of creating healthier metabolics you're getting direct economic benefit in this case you know saving a $50 billion bill.\n\n[2427.0s - 2448.3s]: Yeah I love this I love this Tom and this big step that we're taking toward epoch to and that and that folks like you are helping us take has me certainly excited and hopeful and I'm curious now if you could walk us through epoch three which is yet another big step.\n\n[2448.3s - 2459.7s]: It's a really big step yeah and this one's extremely important and epoch three I don't have a better word phrase for it than the maximization of diverse nutrient flows.\n\n[2460.3s - 2474.1s]: And the reason I call it that is the maximization of diverse nutrient flows is effectively what life has been trying to do on earth since the beginning and honestly probably all life in the universe is trying to do this.\n\n[2474.1s - 2504.1s]: And what it means is you start with a world where you don't have you know an interesting amount of life you don't have an interesting amount of nutrients being exchanged in order to go support life so you go to the early earth right during the Haiti in period that maybe the first bacteria we're starting you know and then and it was billions of years where all we had was like single-celled organisms you know and so not very much diversity and certainly not maximized relative to the world.\n\n[2504.1s - 2533.5s]: So you know what we're going to do what could ultimately come on earth right then you fast forward through the Cambrian explosion all these sorts of things happen that where today we have a very you buy a diverse planet and every organism in an ecosystem if the ecosystem is going well actually helps to further maximize the movement of diverse nutrient flows right basically the maximum amount of nutrients flow and the highest diversity of nutrients flow that's what let all of life is working toward.\n\n[2533.5s - 2544.8s]: So this is almost like the parent metabolic above all metabolics like all these other natural metabolics you know kind of like roll up into life's you know kind of quest to go do that.\n\n[2545.4s - 2562.1s]: And if we were to start aligning our economy with that level of intensity you know with that level of understanding of then you know there's a talk that was done by Richard Feynman back in 1959 I believe and it's called plenty of room at the bottom.\n\n[2562.1s - 2589.8s]: And in that talk because he's a physicist he basically you know highlighted the fact that hey you know we've been building machines at a particular scale like the scale of like a handheld thing like you know a hammer or or like a tractor or you know whatever like like a like a calculator right but actually we can make things way smaller than that there's no reason that the physics doesn't break down if you made it a thousand times smaller.\n\n[2589.8s - 2605.8s]: The physics doesn't stop working if you make it you know you know a ten thousand times smaller. So he basically positive that there was going to be entirely new economies that we create that could be highly beneficial if we were to explore the room at the bottom.\n\n[2605.8s - 2623.7s]: If we could go make things smaller but really useful and intricate at smaller scales and he basically you know like predicted the entire semiconductor revolution in the digital revolution that came after that right and think about all the economic value that was created in that process so not wrong at all.\n\n[2623.7s - 2642.1s]: So I'm basically in epa 3 I use a parallel metaphor but instead of plenty of room at the bottom I call it plenty of room in the middle and just like Feynman I'm formally trained in physics so I think about it in the way that a physicist thinks about it like mass energy balance is you know time and space all the kind of thing.\n\n[2642.1s - 2660.1s]: So like the like one simple way to understand the earth system is that almost all the energy for life is coming from the sun and these photons come from the sun and after a little bit of resonance time on earth they get radiated back out into space is infrared as heat right that's that's how it always happens.\n\n[2660.1s - 2690.1s]: Now if you have a and honestly if it didn't happen like that the earth would massively overheat and if it didn't you know if all the energy state if the if more energy was emitted then was arriving from the sun then the earth would cool to like you know a ball of ice you know the totally you know super cold like you know what cold means in space is very very cold so ice is not even the right framing for it but you get it now so this is always in balance what the what the world is going to be like.\n\n[2690.1s - 2714.9s]: Raising of temperature on the planet is is it means that the energy that comes here is resident with us a bit longer before it goes back out the space but the inflow and outflow is still always the same now given this there's an interesting question of of what you can do in the middle because I call the middle the time between the photon arriving and the photon you know radiating back out into space in the form of infrared or heat.\n\n[2716.1s - 2727.9s]: And there's a couple different scenarios for the middle like the the in the middle the photon could hit a rock and it could immediately go and read back out into space in which case zero organisms were benefited by that.\n\n[2728.5s - 2740.1s]: Right maybe if a lizard goes and lays on the rock later I'll be like oh warm to my belly a little bit but you know it's it's there's plenty of times a lizard doesn't go lay on that rock so like most of the time these photons just zero organisms are benefited.\n\n[2740.7s - 2757.4s]: Now let's upgrade that to a slightly better case imagine that photon arrives and in the middle instead of hitting a rock and going away it actually hits a solar panel well now the people in a household maybe a couple people three four or five people might benefit from it and that's way better than zero organisms right.\n\n[2757.4s - 2787.1s]: But now imagine that that photon comes and hits a green leafy plant and in the process it helps to fuel the the life of that plant that plant you know the plant sugars that are synthesized from photosynthesis go down into the soil and drive the entire you know soil micro by um and the soil ecosystem and herbivore might come by later and eat that plant predator might go and eat that herbivore like detrivoires might eat that predator some point in the future and now we're moving into the category of.\n\n[2787.4s - 2806.3s]: You know dozens of large organisms and billions of tiny organisms you know might be benefited from this these photons coming in and out with that at the middle and if we start to understand that we can grow our economy by by really enriching how much life is benefited in the middle.\n\n[2807.0s - 2815.4s]: As opposed to benefit our economy by extracting the most in the least amount of time in order to make a couple humans the wealthiest you know that they possibly can be.\n\n[2815.9s - 2832.8s]: Then we will have a such a different frame relative to the creation of value in an economy that and not only that the will the frame be different but the frame will be intrinsically aligned with what life in the universe is trying to do which is the maximization diverse nutrient flows.\n\n[2833.5s - 2847.3s]: So that's effectively what what epic three is about and kind of there's almost nothing that we're doing yet in that in that area though in the talk I suggest one which which is now in that company me or Tara so there you go.\n\n[2847.3s - 2857.7s]: Yeah I love it Tom and you know we are putting together a book on regenerative finance social enterprise stewardship philanthropy and.\n\n[2858.0s - 2860.8s]: Ecosine economics for which we're.\n\n[2862.2s - 2877.3s]: Including a number of essays from various VIP thought leaders on these topics and of course you're contributing the essay called plenty of room in the middle for this project and so we're really excited it's a bit of foreshadowing for our.\n\n[2877.3s - 2907.2s]: audiences will be out hopefully in the next handful of months here in 2023 and i want to pause really fast to remind our audience this is the why on earth community podcast i'm your host Aaron William Perry today we're visiting for a second time with Tom she the technologist and finance your founder of at one ventures focused on regenerative and stewardship oriented.\n\n[2907.3s - 2937.2s]: Technologies I want to give a quick shout out to a few of our sponsors including Chelsea green publishing and I mentioned earlier in the discussion one of their authors this has been raskin whose wood ship handbook has a lot to tell us about working in our own gardens in our own orchards and localized ecosystems with the soil ecology the plants the woody biomass etc and we've got on our partners and supporters page linked.\n\n[2937.3s - 2951.9s]: To Chelsea green publishing and other sponsors like purium organic super foods Wele Waters where you can get discounts on products Chelsea green is offering a 35% discount using the code why o e35.\n\n[2952.9s - 2960.9s]: Purium organic super foods is offering $50 off your first order I use these every day myself love them they're great.\n\n[2962.8s - 2985.5s]: keeping me hydrated and full of good nutrients and want to be sure to mention doctor Bronners as well as our friends at soil works one of the social enterprises we stood up that has blended biodynamic preparations in a jar that you can use for your garden your yard your house plants even.\n\n[2985.5s - 3000.6s]: And of course a very special thank you to our ambassadors who are very engaged in our work we have a monthly online meetup regeneration renaissance roundtable meetup the first Sunday of each month you can go to why on earth.\n\n[3000.6s - 3002.4s]: or live.\n\n[3003.5s - 3030.1s]: For any of those those are at 11 3 a.m. Rocky mountain time Colorado time if you'd like to join the first Sunday of each month and many of our ambassadors contribute to the why on earth communities work through our monthly giving program and you can go to the donate button at why on earth.org to set up your own monthly giving if you'd like to do so and if you give at the $33 or greater level will be happy to send you.\n\n[3030.9s - 3046.6s]: Jar's of our waley waters regeneratively grown biodynamically grown hemp infused a Roman therapy soaking salts as a thank you each month depending on the levels that you give so thanks to everybody who's helping support our podcast series and our.\n\n[3047.3s - 3076.6s]: Stewardship regeneration and sustainability work at the why on earth community and of course we're focusing more and more on some of the important work being done around economics and economic systems Tom and you and I have had a chance to chat on this over the last few months and I I so appreciate one really important fundamental fact here that you point out regarding whether or not economics is actually a science and of course many of us are.\n\n[3079.3s - 3084.9s]: So Tom please take it away and tell us what's going on with economics as a discipline.\n\n[3086.2s - 3103.2s]: Yeah so you know economists like to refer to it as the the the dismal science and they like to kind of point to their economic theories as basically being something foundational like you know almost like a law of the universe that's what they would hope it would be.\n\n[3103.2s - 3120.7s]: In practice we've had the you know the quote unquote best economist with the best you know theories in all these different roles in senior government roles and senior roles in terms of designing economies and we just cannot get a stable one to be around for more than five 10 years.\n\n[3120.7s - 3138.9s]: So that doesn't strike me as like a law of the universe like when we learned you know how gravity works on earth we could engineer with that literally forever we use that to design bridges we use that to you know like think about the movement of a ball when you're throwing sports that you know throwing it around in the sport like.\n\n[3138.9s - 3168.8s]: Like it works everywhere and it works really consistently that's what happens when you do a good job at science and yeah in my own career I was a scientist I was an astrophysicist for six years I studied things in the natural world and I understood how they actually worked and we could repeatedly show that they kind of worked in that way that's what science is like economics is not that at all like it clearly doesn't have those artifacts of like discovering a stable thing in that working forever but it is actually a different sort of thing.\n\n[3168.8s - 3186.6s]: Which is not a bad thing at all I like have a lot of respect for this other type of discipline but it's not a scientific discipline it's a design discipline and the nature of a design discipline is you try to make things in a particular way and then you notice how they work and based on how they work you fix the design.\n\n[3187.3s - 3216.6s]: So if we if economics was a toaster and we designed a toaster a particular way and then then 90% like all of the all of the toast went to the top 1% and like the bottom 10% like you know like shocked themselves and died you'd be like this is a poorly designed toaster I don't want 10% of people to like be gravely harmed by the thing that we designed right like I don't want that you know the toast only works for like 1 to 10% of the people right and then the other folks get\n\n[3216.6s - 3238.4s]: okay toast like this would be very poorly designed now because we believe it's a science or a bunch of the practitioners that believe that's a science like guys there's nothing you can do this is just how toasters work like you just need to accept that 10% of you are going to get shocked and hurt by the thing that's just how toasters work you can improve it and it's like this is the cost of not understanding what discipline you're in.\n\n[3238.4s - 3268.4s]: Now we've actually seen the economics design discipline because in a lot of different countries around the world they do it slightly differently from each other and we'll see in some countries that you know their health care system works a lot better in terms of total outcomes across the populace and in other countries you know like they their labor laws work a lot better you know in terms of like being able to have people have you know high integrity jobs that they can really build a craft and and really contribute through and we can see an up\n\n[3268.4s - 3286.5s]: to the other places you know many opposite effects of that which is effectively the information that you use to improve how you design like a professional designer doesn't have everyone in the designs work perfectly the first time nobody does in fact any professional designer is very used to the fact that 90% of the stuff on the way there you're going to throw out.\n\n[3287.3s - 3306.9s]: Ultimately you'll get to the design that works whether it's a toaster or a car or like whatever you wear pieces software you will eventually get to the design that works and like you know does something useful for people but you are used to throwing 90% of it out and what you know economists have become instead is they're insanely precious about their theories.\n\n[3306.9s - 3319.2s]: They don't pay attention to the fact that it ends up hurting a bunch of people at the end that's not interesting information to them because they believe they have the fundamental theory of so and so which honestly is not even being a good scientist by the way.\n\n[3319.3s - 3336.8s]: The scientists do respond to data that is contrary to to their theories but it's like because economists believe they are practicing some sort of dismal science and I would say they're dismal at science and it's not a science but like you know as opposed to just embracing the fact that you are designers and as designers\n\n[3336.8s - 3348.6s]: you should expect to iterate you should expect to throw things out you should expect to learn from every type of design that's already deployed as opposed to say well the USA is the best we know how to run economies the best and say well I don't know.\n\n[3349.2s - 3366.1s]: I mean there's a lot of people look in terms of total GDP sure that's a thing nice job it like that's one metric that you might get excited about but once again in like the zeroth epoch of ecological sensibility not even in the first epoch so you're succeeding at something terrible by the way.\n\n[3366.1s - 3395.9s]: But anyhow it's like you know one might say like great if you want to have a bunch of G.P. then there's some stuff that America is doing that works but if you want to have like a a prosperous civilization then there's a lot of things that we're doing that don't work and like it a somebody that was coming out with a design discipline sensibility is able to go and really synthesize all that information take in things that counter their their early ideas and theories that counter the early prototypes that they're working with or\n\n[3395.9s - 3425.9s]: even the previous version of their economic product right but like let's get out there and treat it like a design discipline and iterate towards something that really works for people as opposed to you know like putting these people in an ivory tower and believing them without you know like a second thought and then needing to have like massive political change in order to get a little bit of design done like imagine we had to march in the streets in order to iterate the next version of a toaster like we would have terrible toasters forever and like right now we're in the middle of the world.\n\n[3425.9s - 3433.0s]: So in that state with our economy like we need people need to march in the streets in order to try to like get slightly different people to design the next toaster.\n\n[3433.8s - 3449.3s]: Let me ask you this you know you spend so much of your time and energy focusing on technologies entrepreneurs investors that can really help push us forward through these epochs that you've articulated.\n\n[3449.3s - 3479.2s]: I'm curious when it comes to some of the more social cultural even justice oriented questions that you're now referring to what do you see as some of the design changes or opportunities or might even call them needs that we need to see a whole lot more of within our economic systems and structures and strategies that would help bring more balance to prosperity widespread among humanity and\n\n[3479.3s - 3482.8s]: care of planet simultaneously like what's needed.\n\n[3483.4s - 3494.8s]: Yeah I'm glad that you that you asked that because one of the most the most important idea in a design discipline is to understand your design constraints.\n\n[3495.5s - 3507.7s]: Right and I ran a bunch of you know a product experience and and user research teams and all these sorts of things and also designers that a lot of times they came from an art background.\n\n[3507.7s - 3513.1s]: And I would say I would teach them that art is about freedom design is about constraints.\n\n[3513.6s - 3517.2s]: We don't understand constraints you're not going to be able to do a good job of designing.\n\n[3518.3s - 3534.8s]: Now relative to these kind of larger social issues we should have as a constraint whether you want to put it you know it whether like in our previous part of the conversation whether you want to take some aspects of natural metabolics and put it in a category of sacredness.\n\n[3534.8s - 3539.2s]: Well putting in a category of sacredness is effectively creating a type of design constraint around it.\n\n[3540.2s - 3548.1s]: Right so that subsequent ecological sorry economical iterations can factor that in in the design discipline of economics as a design constraint.\n\n[3548.7s - 3562.9s]: One could also put in there like at various aspects of social justice that we've been waiting for and working on and also marching in the streets for once again it's very slow to get one iteration to have a four year presidential cycle to get one iteration of a design.\n\n[3562.9s - 3567.8s]: Right designers actually would work way better when they can do five iterations in a week.\n\n[3568.4s - 3585.3s]: So this is why it's taking so long to track but like yes as part of the next rev of economic design we should have you know some way stronger foundations in terms of the design constraints that come from society.\n\n[3585.9s - 3608.9s]: And the thing that is like really mucked with us beyond the mythos of of economics as a science is this idea of like the invisible hand where it's like oh well the invisible hand like cares about all people lips all boats since like we've seen many times it's not true so like clearly that theory is fully wrong but to the extent that you believe in that theory you absorb yourself of all these design constraints.\n\n[3608.9s - 3635.0s]: Oh there's people that are poor today but the invisible hand will eventually lift their boats so like we don't need to design anything differently so that's them basically failing a fundamental design constraint like a classic example of design constraint is cost right if the thing you know is not affordable then you failed at your design but imagine you just got rid of that as a design constraint and people are late and like whatever maybe the the drink your drinking right now it's like okay.\n\n[3635.0s - 3665.0s]: Yeah we made it the very most nutritious it's only $40,000 an ounce since like you have fully failed at this right and this is what's happening right now because we haven't added a useful design constraint both around ecological sacredness and also you know societal sacredness there's some things that we should actually just you know deeply care about in society and they should not be up on the auction block for debate they should be things that are just understood to be human beings.\n\n[3665.0s - 3677.0s]: Human rights, societal rights you know at the purpose of a functioning society and they go into your basic design constraints as opposed to in the mix of things that could just be lost as you decide to make it a different way.\n\n[3677.8s - 3693.1s]: Yeah that's great Tom and we're going to be sharing a profound exploration of those specific topics in this forthcoming book everybody so stay tuned for that I'm so excited to share that with the world as soon as we're able to.\n\n[3693.1s - 3723.1s]: And before we wrap up Tom and go to our behind the scenes chat for our ambassador network and by the way if you would like to experience the behind the scenes chats with Tom and our other podcast guests along with a number of other video resources recordings from conferences and so on and you'd like to become an ambassador you can just go to the why on earth.org website and click on the become an ambassador link and pay for it.\n\n[3723.1s - 3753.1s]: And Tom will do that in a few minutes before moving into that I want to ask you about artificial intelligence it's on a lot of people's minds right now for obvious reasons I think for many of us it's one of the themes that I woven to the novel readie toss that I wrote and was and recently published and you know this is potentially going to affect all of our lives in a person.\n\n[3753.1s - 3755.5s]: And I think that's a very profound way in the relatively near term.\n\n[3756.2s - 3771.7s]: I'm curious what is your view on what's going on with AI I know you've been involved in some of the tech development over the years that is part of this process are you concerned or you optimistic is it a mix what do you think about AI right now.\n\n[3772.8s - 3796.0s]: You know I think one of the main things is kind of lodged in your question which is it was the thing that's coming that's going to affect all of our lives and that kind of gives the sense of kind of a like a enormous force which is just kind of cannot be stopped and I would already stop you right there which is this stuff doesn't come out of nowhere like we make it.\n\n[3796.0s - 3817.7s]: And as you mentioned it's like yeah I have a background I worked on expert systems I worked on you know natural language processing which is kind of the predecessor to various you know types of large language models I worked on you know like AI AI in the context of robotics whether it's like machine vision you know like skillful actuation all that kind of thing so I've like.\n\n[3817.7s - 3846.0s]: And also the term AI is like just a marketing term like really it is like you know dozens and tons of techniques adversarial learning like you know like you different sorts of you know a comical commashto convolutional neural nets like doesn't even matter so much but like I think like one should be a little wary because the marketing term is being used to try to telegraph a type of inevitability to it which is not necessarily the right relationship to have to this.\n\n[3846.0s - 3854.2s]: This is like a wave that's inevitably coming and we just need to get out of a way then that's a very that framing is very dangerous.\n\n[3855.5s - 3874.9s]: If you understand it as no we make this tech and we have the ability to already make decisions on where we want to spend time making this tech then you can end up in an extremely different spot with this and actually there's a real interesting story like I've you mentioned in the intro I worked on the self driving car\n\n[3874.9s - 3894.4s]: at Google and actually helped to get the program up the ground because I was one of the the exact set at Google X starting the founding days and yes like there was this point like after I had left Google X plus a couple of years where I got contacted by the government of Singapore\n\n[3894.9s - 3913.4s]: and the government of Singapore came out to talk to me about you know self driving cars because they kind of felt like well okay once again this like a inevitable thing and it's going to kind of take over but this is what they told me they said hey you know Singapore like we we want to like do right by economic development\n\n[3913.4s - 3938.7s]: but we also want to do right by our people and right now our best analysis like we've like done an analysis of all the different jobs in Singapore in which classes of jobs are consistently lowest paid because Singapore is like a fixed area it's almost like a little island right and like given that then like they can't like end up economically developing more by exploring a bunch of physical resources on their land they just have this little spot\n\n[3938.7s - 3968.7s]: they can only build the city so tall so they can only fit so many people in it so they realize that the only way that they could make anything more prosperous is for every citizen in Singapore to be more prosperous so they basically came to me with the following analysis they said look we've analyzed all the different major job types in Singapore and we found out that actually the largest class of jobs that is consistently low paid is taxi drivers in Singapore so we've already created and this is like you know eight or nine years ago I had this kind of a story\n\n[3968.7s - 3993.8s]: of the first generation we've are in this is Singapore eight or nine years ago we've already created a retraining program for anybody that wants to like get out of taxi driving and wants to have a more lucrative career like we've already started that training program to be able to create a way that they can kind of pull themselves up with a little bit of government help on the education side and as we reduce the supply of cab drivers we want to go replace it with self driving cars\n\n[3993.8s - 4010.5s]: well that's a civilization that is choosing to engage in AI like technology in a way that is deeply thoughtful relative to helping their populace as opposed to the US it's like AI is coming everybody watch out your jobs are going to be gone tomorrow it's like oh my gosh\n\n[4010.5s - 4040.2s]: right and look these were all choices these were design choices that were made by the government and if you treat it like some kind of inevitable force that no human being has influence on then you'll think about it in the wrong model if you understand everything that we're doing in AI is something that is a set of human choices and we can actually align those human choices to benefit you know ourselves in nature as opposed to destroy ourselves in nature then at least we got a shot\n\n[4040.2s - 4059.1s]: but at the particular moment I am very concerned about the overarching narrative I'm very concerned that we're going to put the wrong tools in the wrong place and the reason I'm concerned with that is we already have like the most sophisticated AIs on the planet right now are trading stocks and serving you ads\n\n[4059.7s - 4089.1s]: and the trading of stocks can absolutely damage the physical economy you can you can do a flash crash on the cost of coffee you know in 200 milliseconds that basically puts all these farmers in the developing world like you know out of business or or leads to them like in food insecurity for the next six months just because of what happened in 200 milliseconds because of a a dual-linked trading algorithm that was running advanced AI right so we basically put it in a spot where can damage the physical economy\n\n[4089.1s - 4119.0s]: already and relative to ads we actually put it in a spot where can damage the cognitive economy right so I like to you know kind of kind of laid out simply in it in so much that in the 20th century we spent most of our technical technological effort learning how do mine out all the physical resources of the planet whether that's oil and gas whether it's you know mind materials like you like a metals that sort of thing\n\n[4119.0s - 4131.0s]: whether it's timber all that kind of thing we spent most of the 27th tree strip mining the physical resources of the planet and it looks like we're lining up the 21st century to strip mind the cognitive resources of the planet\n\n[4132.1s - 4148.5s]: because there's a finite number of people on the planet we're going to have a finite number of coherent thoughts in our lives and to the extent that those are poisoned by advertising poisoned by misinformation poisoned by things where some other person gets an economic benefit on the other side of it which is true and strip mining as well.\n\n[4148.5s - 4171.6s]: But like doing it in a thoughtless way like like ocean trawling like strip mining like all these ways that we've done it we're taking the same metaphor and now we're using it in this new plane of existence and AI is going to be extremely central to the strip mining of the cognitive resources of the planet unless we start thinking about it differently very soon because it's already in a dangerous spot.\n\n[4171.6s - 4201.6s]: It's so important Tom in my book why on earth there's a chapter called think in which I speak about the ecology of thinking and I so appreciate you connecting those dots and thank you for your your commentary on AI and other important and related things going on in our world right now and looking at the time I guess we ought to wrap up our episode this time around Tom I appreciate this is our second chat together.\n\n[4201.6s - 4216.7s]: On the why on earth community podcast and before we sign off and switch over to our short behind the scene segments I just want to give you the floor if there's anything else you'd like to share with our audience and once again thank you for joining us today.\n\n[4217.5s - 4246.6s]: Yeah I guess there's not too much to say if you want to follow my work you can go to www.tomch.com or if you want to check out what our venture firm does then it's at one ventures at o and e ventures.com and yeah you'll be able to look in the portfolio and see lots of really you know really interesting investments that we're doing to be able to our tagline is help humanity becoming a positive nature so are you'll be able to see a bunch of them.\n\n[4246.7s - 4273.7s]: So if you're looking for investments that are kind of tailored toward that if you're looking for jobs you can go to jobs that at one ventures.com if you're a investor that invests in funds and feel free to reach out to me and you know happy to go and and look at that relative to you know either this fundraise we got about two and a more months or you know subsequent one and and also if you like know of really compelling things we should be looking at then always happy to take a look.\n\n[4276.7s -
