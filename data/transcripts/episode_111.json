  "full_transcript": "[10.7s - 17.4s]: Welcome to the Y on Earth Community Podcast. I'm your host, Aaron William Perry. And today,\n\n[17.7s - 23.5s]: we're visiting with the author of Honor Thy Label, Garo Lazon, Hi Garo.\n\n[24.6s - 25.9s]: Hey Aaron, thanks for having me.\n\n[25.9s - 27.9s]: Yeah, it's great to have you on. How are you today?\n\n[29.1s - 30.8s]: Little sick, but it's not COVID.\n\n[31.2s - 33.1s]: Okay, that's good. I'm nice to see that.\n\n[34.4s - 40.5s]: Garo Lazon, in addition to being the author of Honor Thy Label, is vice president of special\n\n[40.5s - 47.5s]: operations at Dr. Bronners. Since 2005, he has managed Dr. Bronner's shift to sourcing its\n\n[47.5s - 53.3s]: main ingredients from organic and fair-to-trade projects. These ingredients are coconut,\n\n[53.3s - 59.1s]: palm, olive, several essential oils, sugar, alcohol, and now, coca beans.\n\n[60.3s - 66.8s]: Garo's special operations team of AIT has built and operates several integrated farming and\n\n[66.8s - 73.5s]: processing projects with local partner teams. These involve hundreds to thousands of small\n\n[73.5s - 79.9s]: holder farmers processing operations with two to three hundred people in staff and significant\n\n[79.9s - 85.5s]: social impact through hands-on engagement in education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.\n\n[86.1s - 91.8s]: The special ops team also works closely with and purchases from other projects not owned by Dr.\n\n[92.0s - 98.2s]: Bronners, such as Canaan Palestine and the West Bank. In recent years, all projects are emphasizing\n\n[98.2s - 104.7s]: the shift to regenerative agriculture to improve soil productivity, resilience, and carving sequestration.\n\n[105.7s - 111.2s]: Born in Cologne, Germany, Garo has a master's degree in physics from the University of Cologne,\n\n[111.5s - 118.2s]: and a doctorate in environmental science and engineering from UCLA. Before working for Dr.\n\n[118.4s - 123.6s]: Bronners, he worked as an environmental consultant to US industry in the development and industrial\n\n[123.6s - 130.8s]: hemp and in international development. When not traveling, he lives in Berkeley, California. Now,\n\n[130.8s - 136.2s]: Garo, I know this last little bit about you not traveling. You do a heck of a lot of traveling,\n\n[136.2s - 140.8s]: it seems. Just the process of coordinating our interview together,\n\n[141.4s - 146.4s]: required several weeks as you were, I think, a broad visiting some of your projects. And I thought\n\n[146.4s - 153.1s]: I would just dive right in by asking you, what is it that has you traveling so much and connecting\n\n[153.1s - 159.5s]: with communities all around the world? And how is that approach, which you're spearheading for Dr.\n\n[159.5s - 168.2s]: Bronners, different from how many of the other more mainstream industrial companies are doing\n\n[168.2s - 176.0s]: things with regard to their supply chains? You hit it right on the head, Aaron. How do we differentiate\n\n[176.0s - 183.4s]: ourselves from companies that simply and not that simple, simply by organic and fad trade ingredients\n\n[183.4s - 192.1s]: were available? And that takes us back a little bit to the story really of our work on our supply\n\n[192.1s - 201.9s]: chain. So my bosses, the grandsons of the company founder, Emmanuel Bronner, when they took over\n\n[201.9s - 210.0s]: in around 2000, it was clear they wanted to continue his vision, his vision being cleaning up the\n\n[210.0s - 216.7s]: world with soap. Honestly, he was Emmanuel was driven enough to think that that's his responsibility\n\n[216.7s - 223.1s]: as an entrepreneur. Now his sons have more, have more improved technical means at their hands,\n\n[223.1s - 229.4s]: like there's things such as the internet. And but then they also had a little more sales and they\n\n[229.4s - 238.5s]: had their mom to help and run the company on the financial side. And the question then came up,\n\n[238.5s - 246.1s]: where do our ingredients come from? In 2003, they said, oh, let's shift to organic. That seems to be\n\n[246.1s - 253.7s]: something that shows responsibility and you avoid farm workers in the tropics from being sprayed\n\n[253.7s - 259.3s]: with pesticides. And after a year buying organic coconut, all they realized, oh, we're just buying\n\n[259.3s - 264.4s]: from a broker. And we still don't know where the oil is coming from. And then David whom I knew by\n\n[264.4s - 271.4s]: then from our work in him, who he said, and I was working in Sri Lanka on a development project. And\n\n[271.4s - 277.1s]: he said, can you look around for fair trade coconut oil? Because he thought we need something that's\n\n[277.1s - 283.8s]: third party verified. You want some sort of a certification system because he's very well aware\n\n[284.7s - 293.4s]: of this tendency to just do label fraud or to just lie and embellish whatever you do. So we\n\n[293.4s - 298.6s]: start looking around and then we realized, well, there's no standards. There's no fair trade standards\n\n[298.6s - 305.6s]: for any of our ingredients, right? There's fair trade standards for coffee, cocoa, sugar,\n\n[306.0s - 311.9s]: and not for us. And it was because there was a monopoly by the fair trade international.\n\n[313.0s - 319.5s]: Really on and they didn't have much of an incentive to move ahead and just expand their system.\n\n[319.5s - 325.8s]: So we looked around, found comparable standards number one and then realized there's no supply\n\n[325.8s - 331.6s]: still. So we have to do this ourselves. And then crazy enough, we started building our first\n\n[331.6s - 338.5s]: coconut oil factory in Sri Lanka because that's where I had been doing consulting work in\n\n[341.4s - 347.1s]: in Sri Lanka and had developed friendly relationships with business people there whom I trusted.\n\n[347.7s - 357.0s]: We pulled off an impromptu relief project after the tsunami hit in 2004 that was and then David said,\n\n[357.1s - 363.3s]: okay, this is great. No, let's do a coconut oil mill and we actually did this. And it stands,\n\n[363.6s - 371.8s]: right? It's a real factory with I think 257 and some 1200 farmers now. And we had not the proper\n\n[371.8s - 377.4s]: training to do that, but we had enough skills amongst us to do that. So that's really the\n\n[377.4s - 385.2s]: difference is that we build our own operations that are vertically integrated and you need to do\n\n[385.2s - 392.2s]: everything from converting farmers to organic practices, get that certified setup the system to\n\n[392.2s - 397.6s]: maintain these are group certifications to maintain that system. You have to do the architecture\n\n[397.6s - 404.7s]: then build an equip factory and then you have to run it on a day-to-day basis. So that's something\n\n[405.4s - 413.2s]: that takes a little more engagement than just coming for a purchasing visit every year. And we've\n\n[413.2s - 419.9s]: done this in several other locations and that's really what's kept me traveling for the last 15\n\n[420.6s - 429.3s]: years. You do need to be on the ground to make decisions. And the interesting thing and the same\n\n[429.3s - 438.8s]: for my teammates. So I've spent half the time on the on the run. So this big since 2005, same for my\n\n[438.8s - 446.2s]: teammates, a little less so. The last two years were interesting because since early 2020,\n\n[446.2s - 453.1s]: we couldn't travel. It was just not feasible and then I went back to Ghana first time in June.\n\n[454.0s - 462.3s]: And amazingly, you find that if you have good relationships with a team, Zoom is not a bad crutch\n\n[462.3s - 470.2s]: at all. And I suspect that all of us we're going to be cutting back a little bit on the number of\n\n[470.2s - 477.5s]: trips. You still need the exposure on the ground. So we're there for a week. And that's about\n\n[478.9s - 484.9s]: discussing strategies. You need to look at the side. We bought a piece of land. You want to go see\n\n[484.9s - 491.2s]: that land. Zoom just doesn't do it. But you don't need quite as much as we used to. But the\n\n[491.2s - 497.3s]: relationship is being on the ground, interacting with people, interacting with their communities.\n\n[497.3s - 504.6s]: They really like the farming communities when we show up and show our interest and our\n\n[505.3s - 511.1s]: support of the project. So there's a whole bunch of reasons why you do want to be present. And that\n\n[511.1s - 517.5s]: does set us apart from companies who usually just buy it. That's just very different. We sit in\n\n[517.5s - 522.7s]: there and have financial discussions. We interview staff. We have to help discipline people\n\n[522.7s - 530.6s]: in high end cases as well. So that just requires personal presence. And that's why we're on the ground.\n\n[532.3s - 536.5s]: One of the things that really jumped out of me when I was reading the book, and I'll just show\n\n[537.2s - 543.2s]: the cover here, some folks who are looking at the video version of our discussion. Really a beautiful\n\n[543.2s - 550.4s]: cover and wonderful way of storytelling, describing many of your experiences that you're also\n\n[550.4s - 558.4s]: conveying, many of the principles and practices that you and your team use. But one of the things\n\n[558.4s - 565.8s]: that really jumped out at me is how important it is to have those relationships with those community\n\n[565.8s - 571.5s]: leaders on the ground and business leaders on the ground. It seems that that's really the\n\n[571.5s - 578.8s]: link in the global shame that when it's strong, probably means a lot of good things are happening\n\n[578.8s - 584.6s]: and perhaps when it's not going so well, it can really cause trouble throughout the entire\n\n[585.4s - 592.2s]: organization. This is one of the key challenges. Aaron is really to find the right people.\n\n[592.8s - 599.4s]: Everybody will tell you this, right? That's just well known. And we've made our mistakes.\n\n[599.8s - 605.1s]: There were two cases of fraud on two projects and we ultimately had to let the managers go.\n\n[605.8s - 612.6s]: And I hadn't done this before. So I had to learn. But in that process, you develop a better nose\n\n[613.3s - 620.1s]: for who's driven by what motivations. And you want to pick people that do have a motivation that\n\n[620.1s - 624.8s]: goes beyond just making money. There's nothing wrong with people wanting to make a living. But if you\n\n[624.8s - 631.9s]: provide some meaning and purpose, you will have not a guarantee, but your likelihood of more\n\n[631.9s - 640.8s]: loyalty is important. So unlike bigger companies who may have local subsidiaries and then\n\n[640.8s - 649.4s]: hire the CEO and let them do things, we get very closely involved in the development of staff.\n\n[650.6s - 657.8s]: And to a point that's pretty common here now is you do leadership training and team building.\n\n[657.8s - 664.2s]: All these nice terms, you have to do that on the ground. Because number one, there's\n\n[664.2s - 670.1s]: succession issues. And number two, it helps on motivation that you build teams. So we've just\n\n[670.1s - 678.2s]: introduced some of these more Western concepts into societies that haven't heard much of them.\n\n[679.4s - 687.5s]: Yet, and that, I'd say overall, has had a very beneficial impact. So we just take the time to\n\n[687.5s - 694.7s]: speak to encourage our people on the ground. They're also remote. So you want to integrate them\n\n[694.7s - 700.6s]: into what you do, give them speaking opportunities at webinars or live, for instance. It's the\n\n[700.6s - 708.8s]: integration of people. And it's not just conferences. Conferences, I've been at enough conferences\n\n[709.4s - 715.1s]: myself as a speaker and they're social. Ultimately, they don't change the world. But to give people\n\n[715.1s - 720.3s]: an opportunity to speak, to like-minded about their experience, just gives exposure.\n\n[721.7s - 727.4s]: And data find really valuable. So it's just paying attention to the human, the psychological needs\n\n[728.1s - 734.8s]: of the people on the ground. It's a key element of what we do. And it's the only way to make it fun.\n\n[735.2s - 740.9s]: Right? You want to be able to relate to people. You wouldn't, you don't say they're always\n\n[740.9s - 747.3s]: friends. But there is a lot of laughing at the irony of the world. But it's also about\n\n[748.9s - 755.1s]: addressing the problems they have at hand in a realistic and constructive manner. I think that's\n\n[755.1s - 761.1s]: a key part of our, while helping, many of them are in their 30s and 40s, like the leaders.\n\n[762.3s - 766.7s]: And there's lots of room to support them in their personal and professional development.\n\n[766.7s - 767.9s]: We like to enact.\n\n[769.6s - 777.7s]: Yeah, I love hearing about this psychological and human relationships side of the work you're doing.\n\n[777.9s - 785.6s]: And one of the things I want to ask about next to really help our audience understand the\n\n[785.6s - 793.6s]: geographic range of what you're doing, you have operations in Sri Lanka and the Holy Land,\n\n[793.6s - 801.0s]: both the Israeli and Palestinian areas of the Holy Land, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa,\n\n[802.4s - 810.9s]: and elsewhere, India, elsewhere. So could you give us just a quick overview of the places and\n\n[810.9s - 818.0s]: cultures and continents where you're doing this work and sort of what that means to be so global\n\n[818.0s - 827.6s]: with such a hands-on approach? There's three companies that we own. Or I have a majority share.\n\n[827.7s - 831.9s]: That's in Sri Lanka where we make coconut oil. That was the first project and there\n\n[833.2s - 840.2s]: 1200 farmers, family farmers that grow coconuts, the factory that makes the oil and soon coconut milk\n\n[840.2s - 849.1s]: and cream and some 250 staff. And you know, that's in, I love, I spend a lot of time building up.\n\n[849.1s - 854.0s]: This was my first project. I spent probably a total of three years or so in Sri Lanka to help set\n\n[854.0s - 858.4s]: this up because we hadn't done this before and I was really concerned about getting things wrong,\n\n[858.6s - 868.5s]: which happens easily. And that's a culture, I guess that's seen a lot of foreigners. You don't\n\n[868.5s - 874.4s]: feel all that foreign and I'm not sure whether that's the question, but I used to travel a lot when\n\n[874.4s - 883.3s]: I was younger. So we would drive as far as Iran from Germany and so you just know and I didn't\n\n[883.3s - 890.9s]: like Germany too much. I want to say that. So as soon as I could, I went to Holland. And it\n\n[892.2s - 898.1s]: is fitting in with the local culture isn't as tricky as some people make it sound, but you\n\n[898.1s - 904.5s]: definitely want to be sensitive to local traditions, but you also don't want to overblow it.\n\n[904.5s - 910.5s]: The one thing I've learned is people are not that different. In most places they laugh about similar\n\n[910.5s - 917.7s]: jokes if they have a sense of humor that is. And so I like comparing them. So that's Sri Lanka,\n\n[917.7s - 926.7s]: I'd say they're the nicest natural smiles on the planet come from Sri Lanka. People do\n\n[927.2s - 933.4s]: smile and the silliest thing is when you ask Sri Lankans to smile for a photo. It doesn't come a lot\n\n[933.4s - 940.9s]: so well. Then in Ghana we started in just at the same time we started our palm oil product,\n\n[941.1s - 946.3s]: right? And palm oil is a bad oil as everybody knows. And of course for us it couldn't come from a\n\n[946.3s - 954.2s]: large plantation that was planted on burnt down tropical forests. So this was existing small\n\n[954.2s - 960.8s]: holder agriculture on two to five acres a piece and then helping farmers improve the productivity,\n\n[961.2s - 967.3s]: pay better prices and then employ mostly unscrupulous local women. Now this is in the country side.\n\n[968.7s - 974.1s]: And there it's a little different yes, but it's by then we had I had gotten used to this. So you\n\n[974.1s - 980.0s]: argue with people about their expectations they think it's white people are coming and they\n\n[980.5s - 985.0s]: they want to dump they had heard of development projects and the free money to be had, right? So\n\n[985.0s - 993.9s]: you need to overcome those expectations that people have of you and that typically takes two to\n\n[993.9s - 999.5s]: three years. You want to make sure that people understand the only thing you want is you want to buy\n\n[1000.2s - 1005.7s]: agricultural products at a fair price support farmers in the process and you want to employ\n\n[1005.7s - 1011.9s]: people on fair and respectful terms and on top of this you put quite a bit of money into\n\n[1012.9s - 1019.2s]: fair trade projects into local schools into the healthcare system into infrastructure,\n\n[1019.6s - 1028.1s]: into training people and those are the settings and they're all different rather different,\n\n[1028.1s - 1036.0s]: but ultimately they're not. India is a trip we don't own that project used to but we closed it down\n\n[1036.0s - 1043.5s]: for fraud but rather facilitated a few of our honest field officers to start their own projects and\n\n[1043.5s - 1051.3s]: we're by far the largest customer and that is a project that's yet to save India. India is a difficult\n\n[1052.1s - 1058.3s]: place in many respects, right? It's a bit chaotic and to see a bunch of young guys\n\n[1059.4s - 1066.4s]: wanting to take on the task of shifting field agriculture from what was super\n\n[1067.8s - 1074.5s]: chemistry intensive to compost agriculture. You rebuild the humus content of the soil by making\n\n[1074.5s - 1083.0s]: compost growing cover crops and tilling less while at the same time diversifying their rather dense\n\n[1084.9s - 1092.4s]: crop that's the task there and maybe this is a nice example so people understand our business\n\n[1092.4s - 1098.3s]: model like we started out of course by thinking these projects will produce ingredients for us\n\n[1098.3s - 1106.9s]: Dr. Broners but really fast we saw that having a company with a single product and a single\n\n[1106.9s - 1114.1s]: customer is just a really really dumb idea because number one you make that company entirely dependent\n\n[1114.1s - 1120.8s]: upon potential fluctuations in Dr. Broner's demands even though we mostly go up but this year for\n\n[1120.8s - 1127.2s]: instance we had to cut back a little asia was fantastic this year is slower and you don't really\n\n[1127.2s - 1133.8s]: want other companies to be entirely dependent on you number one number two you want these companies\n\n[1134.6s - 1140.8s]: in Ghana and India and elsewhere you want them to develop relationship with other buyers you want\n\n[1140.8s - 1147.2s]: them to see that the world is much more complex and that there's companies other than Dr. Broners and\n\n[1148.4s - 1154.7s]: you don't want them to focus just on the single product that you yourself buy and India is a great\n\n[1154.7s - 1162.2s]: example for that it's so the farmers there I think we're getting close to 3000 now the farmers\n\n[1162.2s - 1168.7s]: grow three crops per year you can do that in Uttar Pradesh if you have enough water and our\n\n[1169.3s - 1176.0s]: mint for our mint or is is their cash crop but they grow all kinds of other crops and that's weed and\n\n[1176.0s - 1186.1s]: rice and then there is a lot of medicinal herbs so what we did is to find a customer here in the\n\n[1186.1s - 1195.0s]: United States who's interested in regeneratively certified herbs this with this trend towards\n\n[1195.0s - 1202.5s]: regenerative starts paying off so this is a respected nutritional supplement company who is\n\n[1202.5s - 1211.0s]: looking for a trustworthy Indian supplier so we're now starting to supply Tulsi holy basil to them\n\n[1211.0s - 1217.6s]: there's chamomile and all the sudden there's a whole other list of herbs that can be grown where we are\n\n[1218.8s - 1225.3s]: and that'll help farmers diversify they can sell products with a fair and an organic premium\n\n[1225.3s - 1231.2s]: all right so that increases revenues from the field you have to do that if you want farmers to have\n\n[1232.5s - 1241.6s]: a better income and it also connects farmers to other companies and it's really fun for me\n\n[1242.3s - 1248.5s]: to over the last two years and rock the the regenerative organic certification that we now have on\n\n[1249.3s - 1258.3s]: three of our four projects is to have that serve as an interest speaker that gets company come to look\n\n[1258.9s - 1261.7s]: and see whether we might be able to produce something for them\n\n[1262.5s - 1269.0s]: and it's it's really fun and it diversifies peanuts from India is something that we're now doing\n\n[1269.0s - 1274.9s]: you know they grow a lot of legumes peanut is a legume and so we did our first container of peanuts\n\n[1274.9s - 1283.8s]: to a great customer in Germany so it's just expanding what they produce as rock put it into export\n\n[1283.8s - 1288.4s]: while not ignoring the local market tool so it's about diversification\n\n[1288.4s - 1298.3s]: um for for business reasons and also for storytelling reasons and for for exchange for\n\n[1298.3s - 1304.8s]: exposure of those projects to other customers as well and that's one of my my big hobbies now\n\n[1304.8s - 1310.5s]: it's just to help establish contact and and mind you those companies we don't own we don't get\n\n[1311.3s - 1318.1s]: a commission on it right so this is a service Dr. Bronis provides my salary pays for that\n\n[1318.4s - 1323.1s]: and and that of my my staff it's just to facilitate\n\n[1324.4s - 1329.6s]: business creation between our projects and customers abroad and\n\n[1331.4s - 1340.2s]: yeah thank you for for sharing all of that it helps the form of picture and uh you you've mentioned\n\n[1340.2s - 1346.7s]: rock the regenerative organic certification regime a couple of times and of course we've had\n\n[1346.7s - 1352.5s]: David Broner and Ryan's in your colleagues on other episodes talking a bit about this but\n\n[1352.5s - 1357.5s]: for our audience who maybe haven't yet uh listened to those episodes could you just walk us through\n\n[1357.5s - 1364.7s]: what is this regenerative organic certification and and how was uh Dr. Broner's instrumental in helping\n\n[1364.7s - 1369.8s]: to basically launch this in a community with a few other companies and organizations\n\n[1369.8s - 1378.1s]: yep so ultimately I would say this regenerative quote movement came out of a\n\n[1379.6s - 1387.2s]: of a dissatisfaction with what organic agriculture does right and I believe many in the audience\n\n[1387.2s - 1393.1s]: don't know exactly what organic is neither neither did I when we started this whole show in 2005\n\n[1394.1s - 1400.8s]: and originally say in bio dynamic organic agriculture the idea was also to\n\n[1402.1s - 1410.6s]: pay attention to the the quality and the help of the soil and that usually means just you know\n\n[1410.6s - 1417.5s]: maintain a humus content bio have organic matter in your soil because that improves resilience\n\n[1418.3s - 1426.0s]: that facilitates lifeliness in the soil and in many respects organic agriculture has somewhat\n\n[1427.0s - 1434.5s]: come down to being simply but not using chemicals and organic it's more than that\n\n[1435.3s - 1440.5s]: and I didn't know this really when we started in Sri Lanka and we were lucky enough to have a\n\n[1440.5s - 1449.8s]: pretty tough organic inspector who says guero coconuts are all organic by neglect it just means\n\n[1449.8s - 1455.4s]: farmers don't do anything but that's not organic to us so you better think about what kind of\n\n[1455.4s - 1461.6s]: soil maintenance programs you implement and with trees that comes down to pruning it comes down\n\n[1461.6s - 1468.6s]: to mulching then we started the production of compost and this was in 2010 and we started doing\n\n[1468.6s - 1473.0s]: similar things in other projects and then around 2015 this concept of\n\n[1473.0s - 1480.5s]: regenerative organic agriculture came up in the United States this is an American invention\n\n[1481.3s - 1487.6s]: and everybody got really wild about it like this sometimes happens in the US if the new hype comes up\n\n[1488.3s - 1494.8s]: and it was great though because we had already positioned ourselves with our projects\n\n[1494.8s - 1503.1s]: as people who tried to practice regenerative agriculture by mulching by plowing less by\n\n[1504.3s - 1510.9s]: making compost and then there were several groups that thought well we need a standard for that\n\n[1510.9s - 1515.8s]: because otherwise everybody's going to say they're regenerative really so right there's going to be\n\n[1515.8s - 1523.6s]: labeled fraud on a large scale and that's where David Bronner partnered with Patagonia\n\n[1524.4s - 1532.2s]: there was the Roedale Institute and a bunch of other companies to develop a standard it's a private\n\n[1532.2s - 1540.6s]: standard that's been now out for two years and increasingly companies projects apply for that\n\n[1540.6s - 1549.8s]: standard and it's really a combination of basic organic meaning don't use pesticides herbicides\n\n[1549.8s - 1556.9s]: in your productions there's animal welfare there is fair conditions so it integrates things\n\n[1556.9s - 1562.8s]: such as a fair trade standard or a fair for life standard to make sure that anybody employed\n\n[1563.3s - 1570.1s]: is employed on fair conditions payment terms and respects and on top of this is a focus on\n\n[1570.1s - 1578.4s]: soil health meaning what do people do to bring carbon dioxide back into the soil so it depends a\n\n[1578.4s - 1584.7s]: little bit on whether you're talking field crops or you're talking tree crops and so regenerative\n\n[1584.7s - 1593.2s]: organic the rock standard that we operate under really combines the best of I'd say sustainable\n\n[1593.2s - 1601.0s]: agriculture fair trade and social responsibility and animal welfare those are the three major pillars\n\n[1601.0s - 1610.6s]: of that and it's it's it's it's a great concept you can add it to your existing organic and\n\n[1610.6s - 1616.3s]: fair trade certification it's been a little difficult the last two years because most in\n\n[1617.1s - 1622.7s]: most inspection companies did only remote audits right the last two years were not so much fun\n\n[1623.2s - 1631.2s]: to do inspection and certifications because you couldn't travel so I'll pretty interesting but that'll\n\n[1631.2s - 1637.5s]: change so ultimately the rock standard is a standard that on the highest level integrates requirements\n\n[1637.5s - 1646.9s]: for treatment of people treatment of animals and treatment of the soil and and to me it's it's\n\n[1647.0s - 1654.7s]: got more of a visionary feel to it than just organic does because it's not just about not having\n\n[1654.7s - 1661.8s]: pesticide residues in your food but it's about how it's grown and how does it affect the soil the\n\n[1661.8s - 1667.6s]: people and the animals in the neighborhoods right and I find that super inspiring to me it's\n\n[1667.6s - 1673.9s]: ultimately also about being more productive and for farmers to make more money because depending\n\n[1673.9s - 1681.1s]: on how you do it you actually stand a chance of of increasing your yields and thus your revenue\n\n[1682.1s - 1689.0s]: not only by selling into an export market but simply producing more all right so it's it's quite a\n\n[1689.0s - 1696.7s]: concept it sounds great implementing it on the ground it's just not without work and it does require\n\n[1697.5s - 1705.3s]: money so we do go for grants development grants I like getting them from the German government\n\n[1707.0s - 1713.0s]: and there's a real interest in what we do is work directly with smallholder farm be present\n\n[1713.0s - 1719.1s]: and not just train be present engage with them buy from them right that adds to that right it's just\n\n[1719.1s - 1728.0s]: the exchange of goods for money or employing people and paying them away it's just the blood of\n\n[1728.5s - 1733.5s]: the economy and so we're just in the middle of that we don't just buy we actually engage on\n\n[1733.5s - 1741.6s]: on on different fronts and the rock standard kind of sets the framework for that and we think\n\n[1741.6s - 1748.7s]: it's a pretty good one and if folks are interested in learning more about the rock standard\n\n[1749.6s - 1755.4s]: the do you know what what's the organization of the URL they should go to to to find out more\n\n[1755.4s - 1762.3s]: information so as far as the standard goals there is the ROA the regenerative organic\n\n[1764.7s - 1771.7s]: association I'm not sure it's probably ROA.org so this is here in in northern California they\n\n[1771.7s - 1778.5s]: describe the standard on all its aspects more general the regenerative international has a website\n\n[1779.3s - 1787.0s]: and then you find a bunch of companies and the dr. Bronners has a lot of coverage on our website\n\n[1787.7s - 1798.3s]: drbronner.com Patagonia has now a they have their own internet shop that sells their own regenerative\n\n[1798.3s - 1810.6s]: products and those of other companies including ours and I'm mind you you know work this is early\n\n[1810.6s - 1818.1s]: days still so there's a lack of product right because our coconut oil is regenerative organic but\n\n[1818.1s - 1823.2s]: that's a single ingredient and it wasn't that difficult to to launch that so this was I think the\n\n[1823.2s - 1828.9s]: first consumer product ever is our coconut oil and we want to do the same with our soaps\n\n[1828.9s - 1838.8s]: our chocolates are on their way to regenerative certification then there is fruits that are coming\n\n[1838.8s - 1845.7s]: cotton is coming this fish this grains right so just the universe of regenerative certified\n\n[1846.8s - 1853.4s]: ingredients is gradually growing and it'll grow faster once there's easier access for\n\n[1854.9s - 1861.6s]: inspectors after the pandemic is over which I don't know exactly when that is going to be but we'll\n\n[1861.6s - 1873.4s]: see so I'm so curious to ask you as an author myself with all that you have going on in your role\n\n[1873.4s - 1879.3s]: as vice president of special operations as drbronners and in all of these different projects you're\n\n[1879.3s - 1888.8s]: connected with what compelled you to write a book a and b where did you write it I'm curious\n\n[1888.8s - 1893.7s]: we're not rewriting while you're on the road or did you sort of take a little you know hiatus\n\n[1893.7s - 1901.7s]: radical to write how did that work for you it's that the drive came but the several my father\n\n[1901.7s - 1910.1s]: was a publisher right so I grew up with books and the kind of stories I had over the last 20 some\n\n[1910.1s - 1917.8s]: even 30 years or not not so boring overall and I I thought this may not be a bad idea to just\n\n[1917.8s - 1923.7s]: represent this because there's many people who have had bits and pieces of that story and I thought\n\n[1923.7s - 1929.4s]: this should be maybe explained and I'm a scientist I like explaining things and I thought what\n\n[1929.4s - 1936.1s]: what better than explaining how you know mixed agroforestry works or how salt is being made so I'm\n\n[1936.1s - 1943.3s]: I have somewhat of a of a teacher in me it was sad and then of course there's some there's some\n\n[1943.3s - 1949.2s]: mystique around drbronners but not too many people really know what we do all to everybody knows\n\n[1949.2s - 1954.8s]: where great well that's great but it's just not very specific and so I conspired with Ryan\n\n[1954.8s - 1963.5s]: Fletcher our head of PR and he did a fantastic job in finding an agent then there was a we found\n\n[1963.5s - 1967.3s]: a ghost writer to help me write the proposal which I couldn't have done I would have never written\n\n[1967.3s - 1974.2s]: this book if I hadn't if we hadn't already sold it to penguin and then I don't don't I don't\n\n[1974.2s - 1978.4s]: exactly how I did this around this was always on the side right so in the evenings mostly during\n\n[1978.4s - 1985.9s]: the day the writer's difficult weekends often when you had inspiration and writing is a challenge\n\n[1985.9s - 1990.5s]: it the the spirit needs to speak to you and if the spirit doesn't speak you can sit and chew on\n\n[1990.5s - 1998.8s]: your pencil forever but nothing happens and then I was lucky I hate to say I think COVID saved my\n\n[1998.8s - 2005.7s]: butt because I had a deadline ahead of me and I still needed to write a third of the book so this\n\n[2005.7s - 2012.0s]: is what I did in the spring of 2020 where I was just at home and I didn't have to go anywhere I\n\n[2012.0s - 2017.5s]: still had to write the writing on the road is almost impossible you just wait to distract if you\n\n[2017.5s - 2023.9s]: need a space you need at least a couple of days you need conversations with Christel and my wife\n\n[2023.9s - 2030.9s]: many ideas came up so I think this was my first and last book it's really very very time consuming\n\n[2030.9s - 2040.2s]: but I enjoyed it it's you know like psychotherapy in a way and I had this urge to just tell people\n\n[2040.2s - 2047.8s]: all the crazy stuff you actually can do and it's not Dr. Bronner's is uni lever and we've got all\n\n[2047.8s - 2052.6s]: the resources that's not the case and it's not like Dr. Bronner's pours millions into it is\n\n[2052.6s - 2059.0s]: those projects now need to stand on their own if they hire a price but there's no financing\n\n[2059.7s - 2065.6s]: of these projects or rather cash inflow into these projects right my idea is to make them\n\n[2066.2s - 2071.1s]: self-sufficient because that's what you want you you want companies that can\n\n[2072.7s - 2079.3s]: survive on their own in the marketplace and find customers that are interested in in products\n\n[2079.3s - 2085.8s]: like this so all these these messages I felt compelled to get out and it just struck me but\n\n[2086.8s - 2092.2s]: I think no I'm not going to do much of this anyway it was really fun though you finally get to put\n\n[2092.2s - 2099.9s]: all your ideas on paper yeah yeah it's wonderful well let me remind our audience that this is the\n\n[2099.9s - 2106.2s]: Y Honors Community podcast I'm your host Aaron William Perry and we're visiting with Garelley's\n\n[2106.2s - 2113.5s]: own the author of honor thy label and the vice president of special operations at Dr. Bronner's\n\n[2113.5s - 2119.8s]: I'd like to take a moment to thank the many sponsors and supporters who\n\n[2120.8s - 2125.5s]: help with the work that we're doing at the Y Honors Community and help make this podcast series\n\n[2125.5s - 2133.3s]: possible and that includes Earth Coast productions the Ledge Family Foundation Alpine Botanicals\n\n[2133.3s - 2142.8s]: Purium Earth Hero Liquid Trainer Vera Herbels growing spaces, soil works, joyful journey hot\n\n[2142.8s - 2149.6s]: spring spa, earthwater press and yes Dr. Bronner's thank you for the wonderful grant we've\n\n[2149.6s - 2157.3s]: received from you guys last year one for one percent for the planet and ecoversity also a huge\n\n[2157.3s - 2163.6s]: shout out to the many individuals and ambassadors who have joined our monthly giving program and if\n\n[2163.6s - 2170.8s]: you haven't yet and you'd like to join you can go to yonearth.org slash support and select any\n\n[2170.8s - 2178.5s]: monthly level that works well for you is you'd like to give at the $33 a month level we will send you\n\n[2178.5s - 2185.5s]: a jar of the Wele Waters hemp infused aroma therapy soaking salts as a thank you and as a\n\n[2186.0s - 2192.8s]: way to help you with your personal well-being practices so a huge shout out and thanks to our\n\n[2192.8s - 2202.6s]: wonderful friends and egosus the most supporters and clearly that is something that you guys at Dr.\n\n[2202.9s - 2210.2s]: Bronner's are really leading the way with Gero and I am so struck that you guys with all that\n\n[2210.2s - 2215.4s]: you're doing in your own supply chain management and growth you're around $100 million a year\n\n[2215.4s - 2224.5s]: and sales last I heard but what's that we're closer to 200 no kidding okay you've had a couple of\n\n[2224.5s - 2231.5s]: banner years I reckon that's good to know and with all of that you also have very interesting\n\n[2232.3s - 2239.8s]: mechanisms within the companies and maintain your own regenerative and sustainability standards\n\n[2239.8s - 2245.3s]: and behaviors and practices the executive cap is interesting I'd like to ask you about that and\n\n[2245.3s - 2252.1s]: and also the company is donating a substantial portion of its net profits which is also\n\n[2252.1s - 2258.8s]: a size of an abortion of its gross revenues on an ongoing basis and I thought Gero if you wouldn't\n\n[2258.8s - 2265.2s]: mind speaking to those couple of points in terms of the the commitments Dr. Bronner's has made\n\n[2265.2s - 2272.5s]: as a company and how that shows up both in the internal company egosus and but also in this\n\n[2273.4s - 2284.2s]: broader network of relationships that you guys are a big part of so it's complex and much of\n\n[2284.2s - 2290.5s]: it is historical you know the company founder had this vision of saving the planet with soap\n\n[2291.4s - 2296.4s]: and that was a crazy idea but he laid the foundation it's really his son Jim and\n\n[2297.2s - 2304.7s]: Jim's wife Truny who in the 90s implemented what was then pretty radical for a mid-sized American\n\n[2304.7s - 2313.5s]: company which is full health coverage for employees and then also just just the way people were\n\n[2313.5s - 2321.1s]: treated right this concept of a family business and family not not in a corny way but rather just\n\n[2321.1s - 2327.9s]: just trying to treat people like humans which all of the means you get involved in their personal\n\n[2327.9s - 2334.0s]: problems too but I guess that was that was part of it and then as the company grew the question came\n\n[2334.6s - 2342.4s]: up what are we going to do with profits and that I think is the real radical departure from what's\n\n[2342.4s - 2348.4s]: usually done with money and I think it explains our behavior so everybody knows when companies are\n\n[2348.4s - 2360.5s]: profitable and they're owned somebody then the profit goes the profit not needed for investments\n\n[2360.5s - 2367.0s]: etc goes to the owners so that's different at Dr. Bronner's there is no dividend being paid\n\n[2368.0s - 2376.9s]: for people from the profits that are being made there's other family members involved but they\n\n[2376.9s - 2383.2s]: don't get paid anything that's based on operations so essentially there's no motivation\n\n[2384.3s - 2391.5s]: to make more profit to enrich yourself rather that money is used in addition to paying taxes\n\n[2391.5s - 2398.8s]: and making capital investment that money is used exclusively on we call it philanthropy and activism\n\n[2398.8s - 2408.8s]: and that is about 7% of our revenues 7% of revenues and that's unheard of good companies who think\n\n[2408.8s - 2415.8s]: they're cool they do 1% and 2% is pretty high we do 7 that's a massive amount of money\n\n[2416.4s - 2421.8s]: and then one could say well that's nice not to pay dividends but how about executive salaries\n\n[2421.8s - 2429.4s]: because that's the other loophole so our rulers 5 to 1 the highest executive salary being paid is\n\n[2429.4s - 2437.1s]: no more than 5 times that of the lowest paid permanent worker in the warehouse and that means that\n\n[2437.1s - 2446.6s]: it's just a new amount of money left over and in your decisions to operate the profitability\n\n[2447.2s - 2451.5s]: profitability is important we need to make money right that's completely clear we operate in\n\n[2451.5s - 2455.9s]: capitalism and you better make some money otherwise you're not going to be around and we actually\n\n[2455.9s - 2462.1s]: do want to grow and we want to be more profitable because that money is used to do what I believe\n\n[2462.1s - 2470.3s]: is just a whole range of super meaningful and important activities so it's really blocking\n\n[2470.9s - 2476.0s]: the access of the owners to their money to a point where they were thinking now of having this\n\n[2476.0s - 2483.2s]: eventually turned into a foundation of sorts we want to remove the aspect of ownership\n\n[2483.9s - 2489.8s]: and the entitlement to profit we want to separate these things because that's what mostly causes\n\n[2489.8s - 2495.6s]: trouble and I've watched this over the last few years is what happens if people are not primarily\n\n[2495.6s - 2504.5s]: driven by motivation to buy a yard you know ten new cars or build a mansion or whatnot they behave\n\n[2504.5s - 2510.1s]: differently and to me the Bronners are just the prime example I know them well I know how they\n\n[2510.1s - 2518.5s]: they live and operate and it's just the fun of being able to make change by simply making\n\n[2518.5s - 2526.9s]: soap and now increasingly food I think is what many people drives but ownership and the entitlements\n\n[2526.9s - 2536.5s]: get in a way of that and not too many other people are as crazy or committed as as my boss is but\n\n[2536.5s - 2541.5s]: there's a growing number of companies that for instance think of not having them owned by their\n\n[2541.5s - 2548.3s]: owners but rather putting them into a trust or so where the owner is not entitled so that's\n\n[2548.3s - 2555.5s]: it's a slow movement right but it's it's something I find hopeful because the other extreme large\n\n[2555.5s - 2563.2s]: public companies they to me just symbolize and I feel sorry for any CEO of a large public company\n\n[2563.2s - 2570.0s]: because they can't make real decisions because they always need to watch the attitude of the shareholders\n\n[2571.0s - 2577.6s]: and that's mostly related to the value of the company you know the stock value\n\n[2578.3s - 2584.1s]: so that's I think what we do difference it's a combination of a couple of financial tools\n\n[2584.1s - 2590.3s]: that we use and structures plus just a very strong commitment to community service which\n\n[2590.3s - 2596.6s]: initially focused mostly on our staff and now has gone global that's what happened the last\n\n[2596.6s - 2603.4s]: 15 years since I've been involved this that through going out and buying in tropical countries\n\n[2604.4s - 2614.2s]: and elsewhere and and then supporting causes of global relevance I would say one being\n\n[2615.1s - 2621.6s]: the concept of using psychedelics and and and psychedelics assisted therapy to address\n\n[2622.8s - 2629.6s]: severe mental issues for instance that a good chunk of the world population suffers from so\n\n[2629.6s - 2635.6s]: that's a major campaign and we as a small company are a major contributor and have been\n\n[2635.6s - 2642.1s]: rather successful and we just raised attention there's minimum wage issues that we've been supporting\n\n[2642.8s - 2649.9s]: in our projects ourselves we kick off campaign some of it is schools and you know healthcare\n\n[2649.9s - 2656.8s]: but there's a great project we do in India which is supporting women on menstrual hygiene issues\n\n[2656.8s - 2664.3s]: which in rural India is a real problem so how they help women find cost effective non-taboo\n\n[2664.9s - 2672.2s]: ways to deal with their menstruation and to just do this in a way as if it was business right\n\n[2672.2s - 2676.9s]: that that's what I really like about you just look at this project and see can we do those\n\n[2676.9s - 2682.5s]: and then you look at their execution and it's not primarily about making the photos look good\n\n[2682.5s - 2688.7s]: but it's about having an impact so we're super impact-driven and that's because we like these things\n\n[2688.7s - 2696.6s]: to move along just like business for them so that's I think that make given ideas so how we operate\n\n[2696.6s - 2702.9s]: and it's not without problems absolutely right you you have operational issues this issues with\n\n[2702.9s - 2708.6s]: staff and there's whatever there is in normal companies but the way we deal with this is more open\n\n[2710.1s - 2718.3s]: it focuses on communication and constructive engagements and it's increasingly difficult as\n\n[2718.3s - 2723.4s]: your company's grow but that's one of the foundations of what we do as a company and I think\n\n[2724.0s - 2730.2s]: many companies could learn from that just a little bit yeah thank you for for walking us through\n\n[2730.2s - 2735.8s]: that hero and I want to just mention really quickly too that folks can find out more and connect\n\n[2735.8s - 2741.8s]: in with the doctor Bronner's community on social media doctor Bronner that's on Facebook Instagram\n\n[2741.8s - 2749.7s]: and Twitter and then doctor Bronner.com of course is the website and it's it's it's so neat to hear\n\n[2749.7s - 2757.8s]: your perspective of the the Bronner family and their values and ethics and priorities and I really\n\n[2757.8s - 2763.7s]: enjoy it in the book and I'll just show one more time the cover for our video audience honor by label\n\n[2764.5s - 2770.7s]: I really enjoy how in the book you have these little two three-page vignettes from different\n\n[2771.8s - 2779.1s]: contributors including true Bronner David Bronner Mike Bronner and others and it really fills out\n\n[2779.1s - 2785.6s]: the the experience of kind of getting the voices of others in the community and the leadership\n\n[2785.6s - 2791.9s]: of the organization and one of the things that really touched me in the storytelling of the book\n\n[2792.5s - 2799.9s]: Garo is the way in which you were able to help facilitate some some really beautiful healing and\n\n[2799.9s - 2808.4s]: reconnection with the Bronner family which was the the Heil Bronner family originally in Germany of\n\n[2808.4s - 2815.9s]: course it's a German Jewish family and we know what the history of the Holocaust and and all that\n\n[2815.9s - 2823.6s]: has happened several decades ago that this opportunity for healing and reconnection had some\n\n[2823.6s - 2831.2s]: real depth and importance to it and I thought if it's not too much to ask I might ask you to just\n\n[2831.3s - 2837.3s]: kind of walk us through that a little bit kind of how you were in this unique position to be\n\n[2837.3s - 2846.2s]: being of German origin to help facilitate this process that occurred this this isn't really\n\n[2846.2s - 2852.9s]: an official part of my job description and I fell into it but I couldn't help it right as a German\n\n[2853.7s - 2859.9s]: the issue of the Holocaust as weighed on me I'm too young in a way but I knew what had happened\n\n[2859.9s - 2866.2s]: very early on because my father allowed me to read books about the Holocaust since I was nine or\n\n[2866.2s - 2870.9s]: ten right so I had a I had a perspective on what happened but I don't I didn't know a single\n\n[2870.9s - 2878.4s]: Jew until I came to Los Angeles but they just weren't too many in Germany and there were\n\n[2878.4s - 2883.7s]: somewhat secluded and there was a there was a taboo in a way to talk about it right there was\n\n[2884.6s - 2889.9s]: and I it always bothered me and so we fell in Los Angeles we fell into\n\n[2891.3s - 2896.7s]: Jewish friends really easily that's just what happens right you have Jewish friends at school\n\n[2897.7s - 2905.6s]: many of your doctors are our Jewish crystal works in art and so I was super sensitive and I learned\n\n[2905.6s - 2910.2s]: a lot the first ten years in Los Angeles just about the tragedy of the Holocaust from perspective\n\n[2910.2s - 2920.1s]: I hadn't known I had not known how much of the the German soul actually we had not me right Germany\n\n[2920.1s - 2926.9s]: had killed or driven out of the country which is what the smotherer and more mobile Jews did early on\n\n[2927.5s - 2936.4s]: and then the Broners were just one example of such a family where the parents of the company\n\n[2936.4s - 2943.5s]: founder were killed in the in the holocaust himself was traumatized by that which drove much of his\n\n[2943.5s - 2952.8s]: engagement you know this idea to the save the world through soul and as soon as I started traveling\n\n[2952.8s - 2959.5s]: with the Broners and we were thinking of developing distribution in Germany David asked me whether\n\n[2959.5s - 2965.8s]: I could support they were contacts like speak German and I was super motivated so I started\n\n[2965.8s - 2973.4s]: organizing trips to visit the two places the ancestry came from that's Lao Piem and Heilbrunn and\n\n[2973.4s - 2980.1s]: both in southern Germany and then just just to dive into the story right and that just added a\n\n[2980.1s - 2986.1s]: layer to me I knew this all theoretically but if you're confronted with the actual narrative\n\n[2987.1s - 2995.1s]: of a family that has gone through this incredible horror starting in 33 and ending in 45 or not\n\n[2995.1s - 3003.1s]: ending whichever way and so I became super engaged in organizing visits and then also made funny\n\n[3003.1s - 3009.4s]: coincidental connections between people who knew the Heilbrunner family from way back then and I\n\n[3009.4s - 3017.2s]: found myself selling palm oil to that organization by by complete coincidence and that's been\n\n[3017.2s - 3023.9s]: been moving and motivating and and one of the the latest climaxes is that we managed to buy the\n\n[3023.9s - 3032.2s]: house where the the first production of the Heilbrunner family of soap started in 1858 that house\n\n[3032.2s - 3037.5s]: was on the market and we visited so Mike Bronner and I gave a talk to the local middle school\n\n[3038.2s - 3042.7s]: and then the house was available and we bought it we're gonna convert it and it's going to be\n\n[3043.4s - 3051.0s]: place where we're slightly handicapped people can live we put a little museum in the in the\n\n[3051.0s - 3056.9s]: basement where the production was right so this is a fantastic way of reconnecting with your history\n\n[3056.9s - 3062.5s]: and again it's not just marketing it's a great story for sure but it's also about reconnecting and\n\n[3062.5s - 3069.6s]: teaching younger Germans that were a little different and that it's not just the grudge there's\n\n[3069.6s - 3074.1s]: no grudge against Germans and many don't know that right that most Germans were immigrated\n\n[3075.0s - 3081.0s]: they felt like Germans it was just a brutal thing that happened but the hatred towards Germany\n\n[3081.0s - 3088.9s]: is not so much people that were affected themselves German Jews so all of these things I didn't know\n\n[3088.9s - 3096.2s]: like so this really enriched me too and gave me a very different perspective on on the brutality of\n\n[3096.2s - 3102.7s]: the Holocaust and how it affected Jews in Germany and also of course in neighboring countries and\n\n[3103.3s - 3108.2s]: it's been and then looking of course at Dr. Bronner's archives you know with all the communication\n\n[3108.2s - 3114.4s]: from Emmanuel Bronner and his letters to Albert Einstein, Richard Nixon, Eisenhower and\n\n[3114.4s - 3118.7s]: everybody else right so that was a particular treat he was an artist and in your respects the way\n\n[3118.7s - 3126.3s]: he designs his letters and just to see that you know the craziness of a person that tries to\n\n[3126.3s - 3132.3s]: single handedly help overcome some of the yields of the planet all that was really moving\n\n[3132.3s - 3139.8s]: to me to see that and then to connect with the family of such a person so it sure enriched my\n\n[3140.5s - 3150.0s]: my job if I if I needed that it's actually a tremendous tremendous story and it was such a\n\n[3150.0s - 3155.5s]: powerful part of the book to read and I'm really happy you were able to share that story\n\n[3155.5s - 3162.8s]: thanks yeah for sure well girl it's been so wonderful visiting with you and before we sign off\n\n[3162.8s - 3169.0s]: with our episode here today I just want to you know open the floors is there anything else\n\n[3169.0s - 3177.5s]: you'd like to say or to share before we conclude our interview well you know those who buy\n\n[3178.5s - 3184.6s]: the book and make it all the way to the final chapter right I went off on a tangent there a\n\n[3184.6s - 3190.6s]: little bit and it's about the question can this scale it's what we do can this scale or is this just\n\n[3190.6s - 3200.1s]: a tiny little blip on the map and we are in a particularly good position but I guess my conclusion\n\n[3200.1s - 3208.3s]: has been my observation is most people actually by nature are pretty good right as long as you\n\n[3208.3s - 3213.1s]: let them and power and greed doesn't get in the way too much and there's some recent evidence on\n\n[3213.1s - 3220.4s]: great books written on the on the subject and I I believe I'm super optimistic is that our\n\n[3220.4s - 3226.9s]: fundamental human condition would make us more prone to just have many doctor browners or just\n\n[3227.8s - 3236.3s]: do economy in a way that pays more attention to others as individuals and as a society and I'm\n\n[3237.2s - 3243.5s]: you know I'm getting a little older now and personally I keep saying this I do not believe\n\n[3243.5s - 3251.1s]: we're going to be acting fast enough to entirely prevent climate change or stop it before I die\n\n[3252.4s - 3261.6s]: but I believe everything we're doing is valuable for many other reasons and one is just doing it\n\n[3261.6s - 3266.4s]: because it gives you meaning and purpose and I think to make that a little more part of our\n\n[3266.4s - 3273.8s]: action in business in particular is going to add a lot of fun too I really enjoy my work and I\n\n[3273.8s - 3280.1s]: enjoy it working with other people and it's not just about working with the same minded that can\n\n[3280.1s - 3289.0s]: be pretty boring if the same mindedness is is pretty understood it's really more trying to figure out\n\n[3289.0s - 3294.7s]: what am I good doing what am I doing with my job and what is it that I can do that I believe\n\n[3294.7s - 3300.9s]: and then act on it in a smart way in collaboration with others that's ultimately the theme of\n\n[3300.9s - 3308.4s]: this this book and I'm I really hope that I can inspire people to just think about it and if they\n\n[3308.4s - 3315.6s]: do get engaged in a company to just consider that and what doctor browners does is unique and not\n\n[3315.6s - 3321.9s]: the same rules have to be implemented and you cannot buy all of your raw materials as rock certified\n\n[3321.9s - 3329.1s]: that's not going to work but there's room in any company that does anything is to just be a little\n\n[3329.1s - 3336.0s]: more open and respectful of the people you work with and then just see whether you make somewhat\n\n[3336.0s - 3344.4s]: of a contribution and if if nothing changes in your lifetime and if we don't prevent the climate\n\n[3344.4s - 3350.1s]: global climate change at least it's going to be much more satisfying for yourself and those\n\n[3350.1s - 3354.1s]: are wrong to write and then I think it's just you know that that's a value by itself\n\n[3355.7s - 3360.7s]: yeah absolutely well thank you so much Garo for visiting with me today it's been a real pleasure\n\n[3360.7s - 3366.6s]: chatting with you same Simir thanks very much for having me around and I hope people got something\n\n[3366.6s -
