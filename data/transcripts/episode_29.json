Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast Series.\n\nToday I am so excited that we have the opportunity to visit with Courtney Cosgriff.\n\nHi Courtney.\n\nHow are you today?\n\nI’m doing really good.\n\nHappy to be here.\n\nExcellent.\n\nWe’re so happy you’re here with us.\n\nCourtney has a very interesting background and we’re basically going to be talking today\n\na lot about honeybees and Courtney is a beekeeper.\n\nShe is also a CN, a certified nutritionist, a CCH, a certified clinical herbalist and\n\nshe is a member of the College of the Melissai which we’ll be talking about.\n\nNow Courtney is bringing to us today a conversation about some of the deeper and more sacred aspects\n\nof our relationships with honeybees and before diving into that Courtney and asking you\n\nhow you got started with all of this I just want to mention that we are in the greenhouse\n\nof Alpine Botanicals in Netherlands, Colorado where Courtney works and it is such a joy\n\nit’s about 20 something degrees outside and it’s actually pretty toasty in here in the\n\ngreenhouse so we’ve got plants and flowers with us and it’s just a lot of fun.\n\nSo we wanted to give a quick shout out to Alpine Botanicals which is Alpinebotanicals.com\n\nif you’d like to see some of the amazing products and get some for yourself that these\n\nfolks are creating.\n\nNow Courtney is also the founder of honeybee urbals and you’re going to find some amazing\n\nproducts and great resources at honeybeeurbals.co so I encourage you to check that out.\n\nWe’ll talk about that some more as well.\n\nSo before diving into this amazing treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom that we’re going\n\nto hear about from you Courtney I’m really excited for you to share with our audience\n\nhow you got started with all of this what happened.\n\nWell Aaron it’s kind of it’s a it’s a wild story I’ll just put it that way so I got into\n\nhoneybees through two nodeath experiences actually.\n\nYour death experiences.\n\nSo I’ll all elaborate on this.\n\nSo yeah started I was when I was 18 years old me and my best friend were traveling out\n\nto Oregon and we were driving out there and in Idaho she fell asleep at the wheel and we\n\ngot into a pretty bad car accident of flipping the car about like two to three times in the\n\nI was asleep in the passenger seat basically woke up with the car upside down and obviously\n\nthat was one of the scariest experiences of my life.\n\nLuckily I was the middle of the night in Idaho on the freeway but a military man was actually\n\ndriving by and had saw the accident and stopped and basically pulled us out of the car.\n\nBut neither of us had a scratch not a bruise no injuries the car was obviously totaled\n\nbut other than that we were fine and in that moment I just remember coming outside the\n\ncar and just looking at the stars and it was just a beautiful starry sky and I just felt\n\nsomething deep within deep within inside that just told me to keep traveling for some\n\nreason and I just listened to that voice and ended up I spent all the last bit of money\n\nI had on a plane ticket to Oregon.\n\nWe were traveling out to Oregon at the time to go to a music festival outside of Portland\n\nand so yeah I spent all my money on a plane ticket to Oregon and when I got into Oregon\n\nI obviously had to hitchhike to the area where the festival was and along the way I met\n\na gentleman who worked for a beekeeper.\n\nI was getting off the light rail in Portland and he had this like briefcase with some bees\n\npainted on it and he was like hey like stopped me and he’s like hey you want to talk about\n\nbees for a little bit and I was like oh sure and he was selling some honeybee products\n\nlike propolis and bee pollen and different things and yeah I just remember that was kind\n\nof my first introduction to honeybees and beekeeping and apotherapy and it was just really interesting\n\nand he had like these informational handouts talking about like the historical uses of\n\npropolis and talking about like ancient Egypt and ancient Greece and from there I was just\n\nlike kind of really fascinated because I’ve always been fascinated with the history and mythology\n\naround those civilizations and yeah so I ended up going to the festival and having an amazing time\n\na connecting with a lot of amazing people and came back to Colorado and not two three weeks later\n\nI got into another car accident where I was driving my dad’s truck up in Veil Colorado or outside\n\nVeil in a wasp flew in my eye and just caused me to go off the road and kind of a similar accident\n\nand I came out without a scratch unfortunately I told all that truck which was really hard because\n\nmy dad owns like a long care business and that was his work truck and it was it was definitely like\n\na hard experience to do that but I’m really grateful that we came out of it and everything you know\n\nis you know to this day still great and but yeah I mean it’s really interesting some people might\n\nask like what does wasp has to do with honeybees and honeybees and wasps actually have a pretty\n\ninteresting relationship and I’ve experienced this like at through my years working with bees\n\nwasps are actually carnivorous and they’ll actually like if a if a hive is weak they’ll actually\n\ngo in and rob out the hive and eat the bees they’re carnivorous they’ll eat bees so it’s kind\n\nof this weird interesting relationship between those two insects so yeah that’s kind of like\n\njust ties that in and then after that experience the honeybees just kept showing up I would be\n\nout at restaurants out on tacos and honeybees would just be flying around my glass and flying around\n\nme and I just started to see them like everywhere and it took some time for me to kind of acknowledge\n\nthat these were signs and it took me sitting down with a good friend telling him you know these\n\ndifferent experiences that I was having and he was like I think you’re being called to work\n\nwith honeybees I think you should listen to this and I did and it was a long journey I ended up\n\nactually going back to Oregon to meet the beekeeper that the first gentleman I met worked for so I\n\nmet him and you know studied with him for a little bit learned from him for a little bit he ended\n\nup not being like the mentor I think I was supposed to learn from though he definitely introduced me\n\nto the world but I knew that his way of working with bees probably wasn’t the way that I was supposed\n\nto work with bees so it took a long journey actually for me so this all started yeah when I was 18\n\n19 years old and it took it took us a few years for me to really find some mentors that I resonated\n\nwith and this is you know I think something that a lot of people well the the dominant paradigm\n\nof beekeeping here in the United States is actually highly unsustainable with highly unethical and really\n\nreally fails to to acknowledge the sacredness of the honeybee and enter a symbiotic relationship\n\nwith them honoring their true nature their biology all those different things and so it took some time\n\nyou know going you know going to different beekeeping meetings bee clubs and I was you know this\n\nyoung girl around a bunch of you know older guys in their 50s and 60s and the way they just\n\ntalked about working with the bees just really didn’t resonate with me my intuition just kept telling\n\nme like this is not this is it the way and so it was discouraging for a bit because I was just\n\nlike I really want to do this I really want to do this but nothing none of this is resonating and\n\nthen I went to a honey festival in Denver and I was walking around the festival and there was\n\nthis woman and she was actually wearing a shirt just like I’m wearing right here because this is\n\nthey made this and it has the bee with the flower of life on it and I was like you I was like I’m\n\nsupposed to study with you and her name is Karen and her in Corwin Bell started backyard hive\n\nso you can go to their website backyardhive.com they are amazing they’re based in\n\nEl Dorado Springs Colorado and they’re just there’s some natural beekeepers they mainly work with\n\ntop bar hives and they kind of came up with this like bee guardian method which is just a more natural\n\nway of working with bees that really seeks to honor the true nature of the honey bee so I was so thrilled\n\nwhen I started working with them and mentoring and just like well a practicing with them just because\n\nI feel like I finally found my teachers in a way to learn and grow in my path of working with\n\nbees and being a beekeeper so I apprentice with Corwin for about like four or five years I still go\n\nback and work with him all the time and just because I I think if there’s one thing I’ve always\n\nlike I’ve learned with this path is you know I think I’ll spend my whole life you know studying\n\nthe honey bee and still maybe only understand a fraction because they’re just such mysterious\n\nbeings and they have so much to teach us and I just think there’s such value in learning from\n\nso many different perspectives in the beekeeping world and stuff I’m always seeking out to learn\n\nfrom other people which is why where I’m currently studying is the College of the Melissa which is\n\nbased in Ashland Oregon and it’s really more of a mystery school and centered for sacred bee\n\nkeeping centered around studying the mythology of the folklore and the history of more sacred\n\ntraditions of working with bees particularly the Melissa who were bee priestesses who came out\n\nof the Minoan culture and got kind of got observed into ancient Greece but also looking at ancient Egypt\n\nand there’s some beautiful mythology in India so it’s it’s really been cool to kind of dive into\n\nthat aspect of beekeeping which is something I’m really fascinated with is more of the cultural\n\nmeaning and symbolism behind it so I’m currently studying there I also am a certified clinical\n\nherbalist and nutritionist I have my own private practice where I work one-on-one with individuals\n\nit’s kind of what I went to like official school four with more natural medicine just because\n\nI love you know helping people and being a messenger for the plants to do their healing work\n\nin others so that’s what I do kind of as a career I’m on a top of beekeeping and then I also yeah\n\nwe’ll just you know started my business honey bee herbals and watched my website this year and\n\nit’s great just diving in yeah honey bee herbals well there’s so much in here I can’t wait\n\nto ask you a few follow-on questions and just just to start you know I also have worked with\n\nCorwin and Karen and Corwin is the person I learned from when I first started keeping bees\n\nand the person I also learned from to harvest or capture you could say a swarm\n\naround the neighborhood and that’s such an interesting art it’s such an interesting time to\n\nliterally be able to with your bare hands touch hundreds thousands of bees and feel their\n\nvibrations and the heat coming off and to help bring them to a great home others in the network\n\nof bee guardians who are taking good care of these honey bees and at time when they really need our\n\nhelp and there’s so much going on we’ll get to that that we really more and more of us are\n\nneeded to help take good care of the bees and the other pollinators now I also want to mention\n\nthat you are an educator as well and you you do a lot of your educating through an organization\n\ncalled the Growhouse which is one in one of the low-income communities in the Denver area\n\nand they’re doing amazing work with food thriving sustainability and you’re working there with\n\nfolks of all ages including doing a lot with the youth and tell us a bit about what’s happening\n\nwith Growhouse and how you’re serving there I mean I’d love to talk about the Growhouse because I think\n\nthey’ve been a huge just inspiration in my journey and I’m just so grateful that that place\n\nexists so I basically I was hired as their resident beekeeper in December of 2016 so managing\n\ntheir hives they have just a few hives we only have one right now looking to get a few more but\n\nyeah and so I manage their hives but I’m also an educator there so I do a lot of guest teaching\n\nand their education programs so there’s primarily three that I guess teach and one is called bees\n\nthe EES three appropriate budding early experiences and that one’s geared towards the like little\n\nones ages four to ten and they just learn about gardening they learn about permaculture storage\n\nships really getting their hands dirty making things they were really excited we’re probably going\n\nto be doing making an insect hotel if they’re final project this summer which I’m super excited\n\nabout and yeah so there’s that program there’s the seed to seed which is geared towards high school\n\nkids kind of teaching the same principles same concepts and then also micro farm which is geared\n\ntowards the adults in the community and that’s really fun so I just I love I love teaching\n\nin the community there and it’s just such a vibrant wonderful place what’s doing such amazing\n\nthings please go check it out the growhoss.org they have a beautiful event on March 23rd it’s\n\ntheir seed swap it’s their biggest event and it’s just so much fun so if you’re in the Denver area\n\naround them like highly recommend going and yeah by the way the yonearth Community it looks like\n\nmay be there on that event too so I’ll be very cute I’ll be teaching the class and selling some\n\nproducts apparently hundreds of people come to that event it gets about 800 to 1000 people\n\nevery year it’s amazing and it’s just so much fun there’s music there’s dancing there’s food\n\nit’s it’s just great so yeah the growhoss is really it’s really shaped my life and really\n\ngiving me a different view on like activism and really giving me a place to like give back so\n\nhoney bearables offers because of the growhoss through my business I offer nonprofit education so\n\nfocusing on you know I work with another organization called plant the seed I’ll be working with\n\nthem this summer so just different organizations that are geared towards you know educating the youth\n\nor and just I do that in a nonprofit way just because I want to get the information out there so\n\nimportant so that’s really exciting and yeah so check out the growhoss and everything that they’re\n\ndoing they’re definitely an exemplary model of what needs to exist in these communities that are\n\njust underserved so if you’re searching for growhoss it’s it’s spelled g-r-o-w-h-a-u-s the German\n\nspelling of house and is it dot org dot org yeah growhoss dot org so okay you’re you’re a student\n\nat the college of the Melissai but really we could say you’re an initiate in in what is a an\n\nesoteric mystery school or lineage or practice and I am so curious to hear what what does that\n\nmean what I imagine you guys are are doing much more than just technical beekeeping stuff\n\nno no not at all I mean that’s definitely a part of it and I think one one thing that I really\n\nwas drawn to with this school and what’s really like all everywhere I’ve studied is that bridging\n\nof science and spirituality and just understanding you know that those two worlds they need to come\n\ntogether so we do study beekeeping you know basics and science and you know honeybee\n\nbiology and stuff like that honeybee health but I’ll just share this one quote by Lane Redmond\n\nwho wrote the book when the drummers were women and we go back and reference her work a lot\n\nbasically she just says in revisioning the past we envision the future and I think that is a big\n\npart of what is being done at the college of the Melissai and I’m still I mean I’m still in the\n\nvery beginning and still grasping you know this experience of studying there and it’s already\n\nreshaping so much of what I thought I knew and really yeah so we study like the you know ancient\n\ntraditions of keep working with honeybees because it really goes back pretty far so you have the\n\nmanoeuvring cultures which on the island of Crete which were pre ancient Greece and they were\n\nactually an apocultural society what does that mean Tulsa that word means they really just they\n\ncentered around the bees and the bees were a big symbol for their spirituality their temples\n\ntheir main goddess the mother goddess was a bee and that’s where the Melissai come from\n\nso the Melissai were later absorbed into ancient Greece and they were the bee priestesses and they\n\nthey served they were basically they were oracles and they yeah they served a lot of the most brilliant\n\nminds in Greece you know a lot of those brilliant minds would go on these vision quests with the\n\nMelissai and they would usually take part in you know eating some sort of psychedelic honey or\n\nsomething like that and it’s just I mean it’s a very it’s very rich and deep and I’m definitely\n\nstill grasping and understanding it that whole area but the Mediterranean cultures around that\n\ntime period around like 3000 BC were very like centered around honeybees and the honeybees were\n\nvery potent symbols in those civilizations not only for you know building systems or like\n\nfalse like temples and stuff like that a lot of the temples were kind of\n\nbased off of like the the idea of the hive and stuff like that and in ancient Egypt too which is\n\nreally cool I mean what not whole year when all that those cars that were happening when I was 19\n\nyears old I actually went to Egypt on my own and got to see you know the honeybees symbols like\n\nin flesh you know on the temple of Karnak there’s bees everywhere on these pillars and\n\nseen different hieroglyphs like with bees you know it’s just being beekeeping that’s near Luxor\n\nyeah it’s near Luxor the temple of Karnak really cool place so in ancient Egypt there’s also\n\nsuch a rich history of beekeeping they were beekeeping is one of the really big lasting\n\nachievements I think of ancient Egypt they were one of the civilizations to really you know come\n\nup with like the idea of more like a more agricultural society growing you know more food for more\n\npeople and they discovered you know that you know honeybees are really good pollinators and they\n\nwould actually like move their hives to different gardens and it’s pretty cool and they yeah so\n\nniece uh which is an Egyptian goddess she’s actually you know kind of like the origin goddess\n\nto the the mother goddess Egyptian mythology that all the other gods and goddesses come from\n\nand she is associated with the bee so in some of the early myths and stories she flies off\n\nin the form of a bee and her temple or the house of meath was also called the temple of the bee\n\nand it was actually what was really cool to me just to you know being an herbalist and working\n\nin the health world is uh it was an education or medical college that mostly women uh ran and\n\nthey focused a lot on like you know birthing and women’s health and stuff like that and I think\n\nthat’s just really really cool and just like a beautiful symbol for it you know not ties in\n\nin a lot of different cultures the honeybee is a really potent symbol for the divine feminine\n\nand a lot of you know in these ancient civilizations the mother goddess was really or some of like\n\nart and this is really a lot of you know some of our most famous goddesses really had a really deep\n\nconnection with honeybees and the honeybee symbol shows up um and they’re they’re myths and stories\n\na lot so it’s pretty cool it’s rich and diverse I am I have so much to learn and absorb and I think\n\nuh if there’s one thing I’m learning through the the school of the Melissa is more so just to\n\nobserve and interact with the bees and that’s really what we’re here to do is you know form our\n\nown experiences based off of you know what we observe and pick up on if you’re working with these\n\nvery sacred magical creatures it’s so beautiful you know there’s so much continuity coming\n\nto us to our modern culture from these classical and even pre-classical cultures and for some of\n\nour audience it may sound like we’re we’re really discussing some quite esoteric uh subject matter\n\nthat may or may not immediately relate now I think it’s important to spend a little more time on\n\nwhy this might be so essential in these times living in the anthropocene where we humans are having\n\nsuch dramatic impacts on the earth on ecosystems on pollinators etc and there there are some really\n\ninteresting things to unpack one of which is the the the the famous or might say infamous philosopher\n\nNietzsche and later Carl Jung who did a lot with Nietzsche’s work have been unpacking\n\npre-classical Mediterranean cultural legacy and have realized Nietzsche in his in his first major\n\nwork the birth of tragedy went back to uh pre-Hellenic Greek culture which is essentially\n\nMinoan Cretan and other cultures around that area to discover that in our in our deep mythos\n\nwe actually have a much better balance between divine feminine divine masculine these different\n\nforces that are at work on our planet and that one of our great jobs now one of our great projects\n\nand works now is to rediscover and reestablish that balance and that might sound a bit abstract\n\nyeah it’s showing up in our social realms in very interesting ways right now and most importantly\n\nwe might say it’s showing up in our ecological relationships and look we we live on a\n\nbeautiful spaceship we all share this planet earth so well engineered no one needs to worry about\n\nthe engineering unless we knock it so far out of balance it suddenly we have to do work to restore\n\nthat balance yeah this is such a beautiful place and we have really disrupted at a at a magnificent\n\nscale uh so that now our main job in the 21st century is to help heal and restore and of course\n\nthat’s a big part of the YonEarth communities work and why we’re uh interfacing with folks\n\nlike yourself and Courtney and uh anyway I think that for many of us digging a little more into\n\nthat history and that pre-history is actually really important to the foundation of how we got to\n\nwhere we are today yeah I think it I think it gives context to the experiences and I think\n\nand and that’s I think in honoring and studying you know past cultures and these histories and it’s\n\nwe’re I mean we’re honoring you know our ancestors by doing that and it’s super super important that\n\nthat information doesn’t get lost I mean I think I’m out like the the burning of the library\n\nof Alexandria like how how like we just all of that just sacred information and knowledge just lost\n\nand I think you know we really have a duty here right now and I certainly feel this calling to\n\nyou know reawaken that knowledge and don’t let it go away because that’s who we are and our\n\nconnection to the earth and the animals and the plants and the soil and the air and the water I\n\nmean that is that is who we are we are a part of that and in in revisioning and then we’ve\n\nbeen looking at these past cultures we we get a little bit more context of meaning to what we\n\nare supposed to be doing and to these connections to the earth and how how we return return to\n\nthat reverence beautiful yeah so beautiful and so important and you know the image of the be\n\nhive persists in a variety of esoteric and spiritual communities throughout the planet as a symbol of\n\nwhat it means to be working in harmony together with with love and with mutual respect and a sense of\n\na greater purpose right one of the things that hive I think symbolizes for so many of us is that\n\nthe super organism of that community is way more important than any one of the individuals right\n\nand I think I like what you just said because this is this is one thing I always try and tell people\n\nyou know in my beekeeping education is you know a hive is not a box of insects it’s one being\n\nit’s this beautiful super organism and when you look at the swarming and the queen and the reproduction\n\nof the hive it’s constantly regenerating itself and you know it’s this beautiful cycle that\n\njust keeps going and going and going and going and going and you know one of my favorite when I\n\nfell in love with the honey bee I fell in love with the world because I feel like when I started\n\nworking with bees I just started to like they teach us this beautiful how interconnected life is\n\nand just their relationship with plants and flowers and the medicines they create you know and\n\njust they’re just absolutely amazing yeah the inner workings of the hive and you know they are\n\npotent symbol for I think one thing that I resonate with so much is sacred service as you know\n\nwe I there’s this beautiful sentence that I learned to know through my studies of the college\n\nof the Melissa that my mentor Laura said that I was reading and that it was I think it was\n\nyou know honeybee’s record represents sacred service is like a beauty path and They are, there’s such symbols of beauty and love, you know, when you look at their relationship with flowers, especially,\n\nand anyone who sees a honeybee pollinating in the flower, you feel that, that love.\n\nThat’s just what you feel. You see love and you see beauty.\n\nAnd yeah, I just think that they have so much to teach us, but I really, you know, how they just like,\n\nselflessly, you know, in the whole hive, you know, there’s no like individual B, you know.\n\nIt is one being that, you know, works together in this beautiful collective intelligence\n\nto facilitate life on earth. You know, we, we wouldn’t have the nourishing foods we wouldn’t,\n\nwe have, you know, the medicine that they provide and not just in the physical world, but also,\n\nyou know, the spiritual wisdom that they give us and what they teach us is, is just so, so powerful\n\nand so rich. And I think there’s some of the greatest teachers on this planet.\n\nIt’s so beautiful. You know, I’m sitting here thinking about, we, we can recall these,\n\nthese almost monolithic figures from Greek culture. I’m thinking Pythagoras, Hippocrates,\n\nSocrates and Plato. And of course, Aristotle and Alexander, the great, that lineage, those four\n\nguys. And to imagine that those men were deeply steeped in the culture of the Melissai and that\n\nthere’s this whole other aspect to that history and that story that most of us probably haven’t\n\nseen or heard of. And how important is it for us to really reclaim and re-see what was going on?\n\nAnd it’s not to get into gender stereotypes or gender roles, but it’s interesting. In the hive,\n\nmost of the bees are female. Yeah. And then there are these male drones that strangely act like,\n\nlike, barbs of, of your going, they’re the ones who are allowed to go between hives and visit\n\ndifferent hives. Yeah. And are allowed in, they kind of trade information. They’re almost like\n\ntraveling news, news, uh, guys, right? And that’s so interesting. It’s as if what we’re remembering\n\nfrom Greek culture is only the drone part of the story. And there’s a whole hive part of the\n\nstory that allows that to happen. And that’s so much of what we, we were, you know, learning\n\nat the college of the Melissa, at least right, you know, been learning is that the herstery,\n\nyou know, that has been lost in so much of, you know, our, you know, divine feminine and goddess\n\ncultures and mother worshiping cultures, you know, have been suppressed or misunderstood. And that’s\n\njust, you know, because who writes history? You know, I mean, not to like, you know, you know,\n\nthrow any prejudice, but it’s white men from academia. And so, so how much of that information is\n\ngetting lost? And I just, and I’m still totally understanding this. So, but I, I really, you know,\n\nand I think a lot of, um, at the college of Melissa, just this belief that maybe the, the Melissa,\n\nwe’re just like this like secret theme, you know, behind the scenes, this like, uh, collective of,\n\nof women of deep priestesses that we’re just holding such sacred information and really inspiring.\n\nI think these men in, in such deep ways and taking them on these deep vision quests and\n\nwhat that even mean. And you know, you think about what came from ancient Greece, democracy,\n\nyou know, think about hypocrite’s in medicine and healing and how much of our, you know,\n\ncore ethics in health care and in, um, yeah, and just that realm come from ancient Greece.\n\nLike the hypocritical. And how much, you know, and then so just like, you know, you can really go\n\ndown to the rabbit hole with this. I certainly have. And I’m exploring maybe how much of,\n\nyou know, some of these really concrete, you know, concepts and themes in our modern society\n\ntoday might actually be inspired by these deep priestesses. So it’s so beautiful. You know, I,\n\nI want to, I’m just thinking about some of our audience, right? And I have so many friends and family\n\nwho are, you know, practicing Catholics, Christians, Muslims, and these, these Abrahamic traditions,\n\nwhich it turns out, uh, includes some, something like half or a little more than half of our global\n\npopulation. We, we have such a deep tradition going back to the, the Hebrew roots. Yeah. And,\n\nyou know, one of the things, this is reminding me of a story. This is why I’m mentioning this.\n\nI want to tell a story, but one of the things in the, in the creation story of Genesis in Hebrew,\n\nwhen what we say God is creating the world, it’s the Elohim, right? And this is a, a group of\n\ngods or aspects of God that have different genders. This isn’t a single male entity. And that’s\n\nin our Old Testament root. Elohim, right? So because I’m thinking of this funny story, I remember\n\nhearing a story about a missionary visiting a tribe here in North America. And this medicine\n\nman after getting to know the missionary for months and months, they became friends. And the\n\nmissionary said, Hey, why aren’t you joining in our Christian ritual? Yeah. And why don’t you\n\nlike what we’re doing? And the medicine man that says, Oh, no, no, I’m very much like what you\n\nare doing. But you only have half a religion. And we too worship the loving father in heaven\n\nin this guy. And we have a relationship with mother earth. And it’s the balance of the two that\n\nallows us humans to live in harmony on this planet. Now, in some of our Christian realms, we’ll\n\nsee a whole lot of the feminine emerging with Mary. And that’s very strong in certain parts of the\n\nworld, especially Latin America. But I just, I think we’re, it’s time right now for this conversation\n\nto cross dogmatic barriers and look at the reality of the situation in which we find ourselves where\n\nwe have been given this amazing creation, this living planet. And we may not have permission\n\nto stay here much longer unless we change our behavior. Yeah, no, we are the time clock is running\n\nout. And it’s scary. And it’s, it’s really just heartening and to just, you know, skate back to\n\nthe honeybees. And I think so much of what is happening with our honeybees right now is just\n\nthey are showing us what we need to see. And they’re telling us what we need to hear. And we have\n\nto start listening. Like we have to. And, you know, so many people, you know, you have calling\n\nclass disorder. And there’s so many different, you know, reasons and the, you know, the reasons\n\nthat called honeybees are declining is multifactorial. It’s so many different things, but it comes down\n\nto our disconnection from nature. Yes. We have disconnected ourselves from the natural world. And\n\nmore importantly, what is happening with our honeybees is we are manipulating nature. We are\n\nmanipulating, you know, the biology and the intelligence of nature to further serve, you know,\n\nin cater to this like mass consumerism, you know, and, you know, mass production, you know, and\n\nthat is, that is the core of it. That is the core of it. And we have to, we have to take a step back\n\nand really like look at this because it’s really, it’s heartbreaking to see what is happening to\n\nthe honeybees right now. And I think we have to understand, you know, that it’s just in the United\n\nStates, we’ve built an agricultural system dependent upon the honeybees. And, you know, because\n\npeople are so disconnected and not everybody, but the majority of the population is disconnected\n\nfrom their food. They’re disconnected from the soil, the water. And because of that, you know,\n\nthat’s, it’s, we’re dependent on commercial agriculture. Yeah. And that system is\n\ndestructive in so many different ways. It’s not just poisoning our air and our water and all of\n\nour pollinators, all of our pollinators are, you know, we are experiencing an insect, you know,\n\napocalypse right now. And you taught, we took in your previous podcasts, you know, you guys\n\ntalked about this, you know, the insects are like the foundation. And if they start to go, like,\n\nthat is going to affect the great web of life. And that is what we are seeing. And, you know,\n\nthe honeybees in particular, it’s just really sad, you know, to see how much of, you know, these\n\nthese creatures are so, so intelligent and just the, and just brilliant and sacred and, you know,\n\nthe work that they do on this planet is so sacred and that is being exploited in such a big way.\n\nYou know, the medicines of the hive are exploited in big ways and that is not okay. And it’s,\n\nwe really need to take a step back and we need to return to a state of reverence with these beans,\n\nbut we also need to take action. And how we take action is we put our money where our\n\nmouth is and we support regenerative and organic agriculture. We grow our own food. We support\n\nthose movements. We be a voice, use your voice. That is one of the most powerful things you can do.\n\nAnd it’s something that I’ve had to come to a long journey with of finding my voice and\n\nspeaking my truth on this matter because I feel like that is why I’m here. It speaks for the honey\n\nbees because they can’t speak for themselves right now. Yeah, beautiful, beautiful. In the book YonEarth, I talk about how powerful our consumer demand is as a signalling out into the world to\n\ntake care of the bees, to take care of the soil, the water with each and every organic food purchase.\n\nAnd it may be not all of our food is organic, but if each of us is doing more organic, the way\n\nthat tips the scales and those supply chains is absolutely transformational. You could even think\n\nof it as being alchemical. And it is so important. And one of the five things we have to do\n\nis stop poisoning our world. We just have to stop ourselves, our bodies, our bathrooms,\n\nour kitchens, our waterways, our fields, our yards. We have to stop poisoning now.\n\nYeah. It’s that simple. And we can each choose that right now.\n\nYeah. We have to. We absolutely have to. I think it’s just we don’t really have any more time\n\nto be avoiding it. There’s no avoiding it. I love one of my mentors would say we have just\n\nenough time and we have to act. But you have to have hope too. Totally. And I think that’s really\n\nimportant. And I think I’ve definitely gone through deep stages of just despair and depression\n\naround it. And I think it’s really easy. And I love to say so much of activism is what we are\n\nagainst in this world. And while I agree that we must combat these paradigms that only bring\n\nabout destruction and disempowerment, I also believe that activism is about what we love.\n\nIt’s what we want to create. And so, you know, in Honey Beerables, I believe we focus on love and\n\nconnection and envisioning a world where space is held for all beings to thrive. And that includes\n\nthe honey bees. That includes the pollinators because really when you focus on this bigger vision\n\nof just, you know, caring for all beings, then it’s just it ripples and that’s the beauty of\n\nthe interconnectedness of life is through supporting pollinators. You support all these other\n\nbeings and plants. Oh my gosh, plants. And it’s just, yeah, so let’s focus on what we want to create.\n\nSo, you know, here’s the problem. But like, what does the solutions look like? So, like,\n\nlet your creative inspiration and imagination like drive that.\n\nI absolutely love that. Let me just make the mention that this is the YonEarth\n\ncommunity’s stewardship and sustainability podcast series. And today I’m visiting with Courtney\n\nCosgiff, who is the founder of Honey Beerables. And you can find amazing resources and products on\n\nthe website honeybeerables.co. Speaking of relationships in ecosystems, I also want to thank our\n\nsponsors of the podcast. This includes Earth Coast productions, Waylay Waters, Purium,\n\nthe Association of Water Schools of North America, and the International Institute of Sustainability\n\nProfessionals. Now, you can use the code word YonEarth, all one word, to get discounts with\n\nmany of those sponsors to get discounts at the honeybeerables.co website, and to get discounts\n\nat the YonEarth community marketplace where we have ebooks, audio books, all kinds of\n\nsoil resources, et cetera. And while mentioning books, I want to share them so excited.\n\nI’m so excited to share that. Many of you are probably aware that we have already published our\n\nfirst children’s book, which is called Celebrating Soil. And this is with the amazing artwork,\n\noriginal artwork of Yvonne Coslina. And in just a little while, we’re going to have the next\n\nchildren’s book out, which is called Celebrating Honeybees. And this is, I’m holding the original\n\nartwork that Yvonne created for the cover. If you can see this, I’ll zoom in a little. All right.\n\nAnd then Courtney and I picked out one of the additional pieces that will be in the book that\n\nwe thought would be fun to share with you all, which is right here. And those of you that are\n\ntuning in via podcast and only getting audio, check out, we’ll have a lot of the resources\n\nYonEarth.org. You can also view the video there as well. And I think I also want to mention\n\nspeaking of what we can do, the YonEarth community is hosting a three-day summit May 17th through\n\n19th. We’re doing this in the year 2019. And it is massively mobilizing sustainability,\n\ndeep leadership for the 21st century, for three core audiences, executives, educators,\n\nand entrepreneurs. You are going to have an amazing experience gathering all kinds of knowledge and\n\nwisdom that you can take back to your communities, to your companies, to your schools, to help further\n\ndeploy the stewardship and regeneration actions that are needed right now in these times. So\n\nstay tuned for additional information coming out on massively mobilizing sustainability.\n\nAnd that date May 17th through 19th comes just before May 20th, which is World B Day.\n\nAnd I can’t wait to chat just a bit about our connection with Slovenia. And there’s such a\n\nmagical piece there. I think that’s really when we first met, how we got so excited about\n\nconnecting with each other. So you’ve traveled in Slovenia, Courtney, tell me what was that like?\n\nOkay, so yeah, I mean, so me and my two best friends went on a beautiful backpacking trip through\n\nEurope this past summer. And Slovenia ended up being one of the countries that we explored. And\n\nI knew that there was a rich tradition of beekeeping in that area of the world, but I had no idea\n\nlike the magnitude and depth of it. And I just remember like taking the train in the minute we\n\nentered that country. I mean, you just know that like feeling, you’re just like this place,\n\nthis place is special. And I knew that I knew in that moment that this place was going to play\n\napart in my journey. And yeah, and it just came to unfold through my time. They’re like, whoa,\n\nlike I just started to see the honeybee everywhere. And just through talking with, you know,\n\nSlovenia, I was like, oh my gosh, they were telling me, you know, that virtually every household\n\nhas a beekeeper. And there was just like honey stores everywhere. And just the honeybee was just\n\neverywhere. And I ended up getting going to an apocultural museum just outside of Lake Blood.\n\nIn that town, I, which I’m going to completely butcher the name. So I’m just not going to say it.\n\nBut I was just utterly, I’d never seen just so many like bee, just memorable,\n\nbilion, artifacts, and information. There was an exhibit where you could go in and hear the\n\nsounds of a queen bee. And I like literally just came out and like just tears. It was just\n\nsuch a cool experience. I spent hours in that museum and got this little book that was called\n\nBeekeeper at Heart, which is the story about Anton Johnson, who was basically like kind of like\n\nthe hero for Slovenian beekeepers. He was a big pioneer in beekeeping and bee lover. And he helps,\n\nyou know, discover a lot of, you know, the concepts and things that we work with with honeybees\n\ntoday and understandings of, you know, working with bees and beekeeping. And his birthday is May 20th.\n\nAnd that’s actually the day of World Bee Day. So Slovenia, yeah. So the reason we have\n\nWorld Bee Day is because of Slovenia and Slovenian beekeepers. And I think the one thing that just\n\nresonated with me so much about this country was it’s a young country. And it’s just, it was\n\nextremely humble country all around their capital, Lubiana. They didn’t have statues of politicians\n\nor anything like that. They had statues of poets. And I just thought that was really, really cool.\n\nThey’re just a sweet humble country that’s in love with the honeybee. And you can see it in like\n\nthe way that they honor poetry and art and nature. And yeah, it’s just a really, really beautiful\n\nbeautiful country with a huge, rich tradition of beekeeping. And I really look forward to exploring\n\nit more. I love Slovenia. So I think I may have shared a bit at the, in the introduction of the\n\nbook Why on Earth that my, my maternal grandmother is Slovenian. And I grew up in her kitchen many,\n\nmany hours in her kitchen. And when I was able to visit Slovenia a number of years ago and notice\n\nthat families, virtually every family has what you would call either a really big garden or a\n\nsmall farm. And from two-year-old little kids all the way up to octogenarians and even people in\n\ntheir 90s are out there growing food together in that family relationship and have that connection\n\nto land. And when I went to Slovenia, I had already studied permaculture and was already quite deep\n\nin many of these stewardship and sustainability practices. And I thought, oh my god, this whole\n\ncountry is essentially a permaculture country. And it’s just beautiful. But they’re so sweet and\n\nhumble about it. You know what I mean? Which is just like, we all like know how like, you know,\n\nsome people can let that stuff get to their heads. And I think that’s just, you just can’t because\n\nthis is who we are is human. Like, I think if anything, you know, yeah, and that’s just like,\n\nI think what I love so much about it. It’s just, it’s just their way of life. And it’s like, yeah,\n\nthat’s all of our way of life. Right. It’s just living up with the Earth in that way in it. And\n\nI just think it’s really, really cool. And look, these weren’t subsistence farmers. These were\n\nsoftware engineers. These were folks running beautiful manufacturing operations that were\n\nshipping gorgeous cabinetry all around the world. These are educators and professors and all\n\nkinds of professionals who are engaging, growing food with their families. And we can do all these\n\nthings as we’re transitioning into a sustainable framework in this culture. There are patterns out\n\nthere ancient patterns, modern patterns that we can really learn from and emulate in a way that\n\nworks well. And boy, we get to improve our quality of life while doing all this food to win,\n\nwin. Yeah. We need that, you know, good nourishing organic food. And it’s it’s a big part of our health\n\nand our well-being and yeah. It’s so true. I want you to share to some of the insights you shared\n\nwith me the other day about the honey itself as alchemy. And, you know, that that we also can use\n\nthe metaphor of the honey tongue. And there’s a real rich connection there with honey and\n\nthat being medicine. And I was hoping you would share that with us a bit, of course. I mean,\n\nI would be happy to because I think it’s really important. And this is one thing, you know,\n\nand talking about the exploitation of honey bee products because it is a really big issue right now.\n\nAnd I think I really try and advocate for a more sacred consumption of honey. And there’s a lot\n\nof reasonings behind that one and a lot of ancient civilizations and cultures around the world. You\n\nknow, honey is revered as sacred. It don’t get me wrong. It’s also medicine. But it’s sacred. And\n\nthe reasoning behind that is what what is honey? I mean, it’s a sacred reflection of our landscape.\n\nI think more than anything honey bee tell honey tell the love story. A love story between honey\n\nand honey bees and flowers. And when you think about, you know, I like to think of the honey bees\n\nas nature’s alchemists. And they travel from flower to flower collecting nectar. Right?\n\nOr collecting wisdom. You know, that could be a symbol for the honey bee as a wisdom keepers and\n\ngivers. But yeah, they travel from flower to flower collecting nectar and then they come back\n\nto the hive and, you know, through community and collective intelligence and alchemy they create\n\nthis substance that is utterly delicious. I mean, it’s so sweet. It’s the nectar of the gods. I mean,\n\nand there’s also like so much mythology if you think about it. You think about the story behind\n\nZeus of, you know, these these gods that are, you know, hidden in caves and fed on a diet of honey.\n\nYou know, that’s where like milk and honey comes from. And it’s just really interesting. So honey\n\nisn’t a six-streaming sacred substance. It has always been seen as that. And I think we need to\n\nwe need to see it as that. And I think of when I eat honey, you know, even if it’s just a tiny drop\n\nof my honey on my tongue, especially if it’s my own honey, that’s a spiritual experience.\n\nIt’s I feel an extremely embodied in that moment. And I feel extremely connected to my landscape\n\nand to the land that I’m living on. And that’s providing for me. And I think, yeah, the honey is\n\njust like the essence of sunshine. It’s it’s it’s utterly magical. And I’m just I really, I’d\n\nthink and there’s so much work that the honey bees, you know, do to to make that substance. So how\n\ncan we return to a more sacred consumption and relationship with honey bee products and especially\n\nhoney. And I think, you know, also like when Rudolph Siner touches on this a little bit, but,\n\nyou know, how, you know, honey is a, you know, eating honey helps with like, it just helps to\n\nenlighten our soul and connects us to the earth and yeah, so. And to the sun. And to the sun.\n\nAnd just focusing on, yeah, just a more sacred consumption of the substance.\n\nOne of my dear friends and mentors has been a beekeeper in the biodynamic tradition from\n\nSteiner for a while. And he was sharing with me that we can think of the bees as they’re moving\n\nthrough the landscape as being like living crystals or prisms through their wings that sunlight"
