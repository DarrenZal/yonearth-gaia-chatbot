I did not like getting shots as a child and because I went to\n\ncamp every summer there was all these shots and it was very stressful to me and you know I felt\n\nthat the medicine that my grandmother was promoting things like garlic and cabbage and apple cider vinegar\n\nI felt like this is medicine for the people and my parents would like why do you want to do these\n\nold wives’ tails that’s something poor people did in the old country and I felt like yeah but it\n\nworks and it’s good for the planet because every time we decide to use a natural medicine somewhere\n\non the planet there’s going to be a field of cabbage or lavender or a canesia rather than a\n\nyou know pharmaceutical company pumping smoke into the environment not to say that those things\n\ncan’t be life-saving but when I was in high school every time I had a paper to do I would turn it\n\ninto an opportunity to learn about herbs so if it was you know Spanish I would write about that\n\nPlantas medicinales de Mexico or herbal medicine during the French Revolution and so\n\nand then I actually treated all my classmates rather than them going to the nurse I had this drawer\n\nof you know rescue remedy and chamomile tea and I was just a kid but I was experimenting on my friends\n\nand it worked of walking pharmacopia I love it and you know this is something that has been used\n\nby millions of people for thousands of years so when someone tries to say like oh herbal medicine\n\nhasn’t really been tested right it’s been tested a lot longer than a two-year rat study\n\nyes in my book no doubt about that for countless generations and you know one of the things that\n\nstrikes me that I discussed a bit in the book yonearth toward the beginning actually is that\n\nwe don’t have to go back very many generations regardless of who we are and where we happen\n\nto be living on the planet we don’t have to go back very many generations to find that in all\n\nof our ancestors all of us shared all of humanity is a background in a past where we use herbal\n\nmedicine that was normal for so many hundreds and thousands of years it is only in the last two or\n\nthree generations where it is abnormal where we have this aberration where for many people it’s\n\nlike herbal medicine oh what’s that new fat or what’s that strange fringe thing but in fact this\n\nis the norm right there’s nothing new age about it it is ancient and in 1900 about 80 percent\n\nof all the pharmaceuticals were derived from plants we had willow bark that came from meadow sweet\n\nand aspen and we had birth control pills that were derived from wild yam even digitalis comes from\n\nthe plant fox glove which is toxic to use as a plant but in 1917 there was a movement where they\n\nsent one man the flexner mr flexner they sent him around to all the medical schools in the\n\ncountry and he was supposed to make a deal with the medical schools that if they would only teach\n\nthe new modern medicine they would get funding and if they persisted in teaching about herbs and\n\nhomeopathy they wouldn’t get funding so in a few years herbal medicine really died on the vine\n\nunless it was you know still being used by tribes or people that lived very close to the earth\n\ncertain religious groups but in europe the herbs never got taken off the shelf they’ve always\n\nco-existed and i feel we’re blessed because if you were in an accident you know the modern care\n\nthat the hospital can afford you is great and i feel that the best of medicine is yet to come when\n\nwe honor the natural remedies and put our heads and hearts together to also offer what technology\n\nis offering us absolutely yeah that’s such a beautiful beautiful vision you know one of the things\n\nthat i love sharing because like you i’m busy working on new writing projects giving talks\n\nconsulting and i have found that in order to maintain a good level of sustained energy health\n\nand well-being for myself it’s essential that i utilize some of the herbal medicines that are\n\navailable and i thought i’d bring some Brigitte for us to share together so this is a teazon\n\ni made last night and it has some beautiful organic and even biodynamic herbs including\n\ncalendula licorice root peppermint nettles and some equisitum some of these were even grown at our\n\nfriends biodynamic farm sustainable settings up in the Rocky Mountains and i thought it would be\n\nfun for us to have a little while we’re talking today that sounds wonderful and those are all\n\nreally great herbs so i love it you know when we’re imbibing herbal teas the plants transform the\n\nminerals of the earth into a way that we can readily assimilate them so my friend my friend\n\nto your health blessed be blessed be\n\nyum oh it’s wonderful licorice makes things just a little bit sweet yes\n\nand one of the things i love about the licorice is because when i’m you know giving talks or what\n\nhave you my throat can get raspy and the licorice helps to soothe that a bit right great anti-inflammatory\n\nagent yeah well let’s talk maybe a little more about the nettles right because i know that you\n\nhave a few favorites in this whole pharmacopia and i have heard you say more than once that nettles\n\nis one of those favorites so why is that well nettles well Rudolph Steiner said about nettles\n\nnettles are the heart of the world that’s a big statement coming from a pioneer such as Rudolph\n\nSteiner and the belief and observation is that when plants that have a lot of essential oils\n\ngrown near nettles their essential oil content is higher so plants like oregano and time and peppermint\n\nbut what i love about nettles is that it’s so mineral rich really high in iron high in protein high\n\nin calcium magnesium it even contains the amino acid lysine which is hard to get from vegetable foods\n\nbut has anti herpatic properties um a german woman gave me one nettle plant maybe 30 years ago\n\nand i moved with it and now there’s 10,000 nettle plants there and it provides constant food\n\nfor us from March until maybe December and you know you might have heard of stinging nettles and\n\nthis is the same plant or took a diawica um it does sting if you touch it but the getting\n\nstunned with it is actually very therapeutic for arthritis and pain soar joints for you know people\n\nthat use their hands a lot of the computer playing instruments so the getting stung is actually\n\nvery therapeutic and it’s like a free remedy um but i love nettles because it’s very blood building\n\nthere was a study done in Portland where they found that it’s very effective at alleviating\n\nthe symptoms of hay fever the runny eyes the itchy runny nose and so forth um and i love that\n\nthe minerals in it can nourish our hair our teeth our bones it’s very alkalonizing and it’s\n\nedible so yeah you know you can uh you know i’m big on adding greens to everything so if i\n\nwere making gluten-free pancakes i would blend nettles up in it and my grandkids get to have\n\nsuper hero pancakes that are green um if you’re making muffins if you’re making uh scrambled eggs\n\nyou could make green eggs no ham uh-huh that would make dr. sus proud um so whatever you are making\n\nfortified by adding more greens and i think the american diet has gotten rather beige so\n\nyou know eat the rainbow eat all the colors is always a good idea one of the keys to health and\n\nwell-being eating the rainbow that all the different colors of fruits and vegetables i just want\n\nto repeat that reiterate that because it’s such an easy thing we can all do more of in our own\n\nlives right at our fingertips right this doesn’t take a massive lifestyle change and you know a lot\n\nof parents find it challenging to get their kids to eat healthfully so you know go shopping with your\n\nkids and in the produce section mind you and then say you need to pick out three red foods you’re\n\nwilling to eat and three orange foods and so forth because you know kids can relate to colors but\n\nhey if kids can do it we can do it absolutely that’s cool so you’re giving them the choice it’s sort\n\nof like a new version of a kid in a candy shop right yeah a lot of fun well you know when i’m\n\nworking with executives organizational leaders what i hear over and over is that they are doing\n\nthings to enhance their level of performance to really be at that that top level that a game\n\nas consistently as possible and it it strikes me that oh my goodness what an incredible\n\nopportunity we have to utilize herbal medicines in our lives to sustain that level of performance\n\nand energy creativity leadership that so many of us are frankly spending all kinds of money to\n\ntry to cultivate in other ways and i’m just struck especially with the nettles patch outside\n\nof your home some of this is not only so simple to incorporate in our lives but it is so delightful\n\nwell there’s a whole classification of plants that are called adaptogens they help the body adapt\n\nand they can help the body adapt to stress they might help you sleep if you need to sleep but they\n\nmight also give you more energy if you need more energy and i’m finding a lot of high level professional\n\npeople getting great benefits from using adaptogenic herbs like rodeola or eluthro which used to be\n\ncalled Siberian jinsing also Chinese and American jinsing holy basil or talsi is another one shazander\n\nberries and it’s interesting that a lot of these plants they adapt they grow very well under\n\ndifficult conditions i was teaching in Iceland and i saw by the side of a cliff rodeola growing and\n\nthe winds are whipping it and the sea foam is crashing upon it and it’s going to be really hard to\n\nharvest this plant someone’s going to have to climb out on a ledge and i thought that’s why this plant\n\nis so good for you because it survives the intense winds of Iceland the six months of almost total\n\ndarkness and then total light and these plants that adapt hold the secret to help our bodies adapt\n\nit seems that the cultural norm has been you know just drink coffee for people that are you know\n\nhaving a lot of work to do and you know coffee is an herb i don’t have anything to say against it\n\nbut it doesn’t provide us with the minerals that we get from some of these adaptogenic plants\n\nand so i’d like people to mix it up a little bit and you know and i know coffee gives us energy\n\nbut it’s like taking money out of the bank account whereas i see these adaptogenic herbs like\n\nrodeola and ilusro putting something in the bank account meaning our creativity and life force\n\nand well-being it’s so beautiful well and i know that a lot of my friends out there are coffee\n\ndrinkers and i enjoy coffee myself but this is not an either or a kind of question this can be for\n\nsome of us a both end and so i really enjoy having some coffee as well as some of this adaptogenic\n\ntea throughout the day and especially later in the day so that i’m not disrupting my sleep cycle\n\ntoo terribly much with the caffeine and all of that i wanted to go back to a thing you mentioned\n\nabout the metals that it’s alkalizing and can you tell us a little more about that what that\n\nmeans and why that’s so important well there have been a number of books written about how important\n\nit is for our bodies to be more alkaline and you know how do you know if you’re more acid or alkaline\n\nyou can get these little paper strips that you test you can test your urine or your saliva\n\nand what we do know is that most Americans eat a lot of food that promotes a condition of acidity\n\nand being more acidic can make us feel more lethargic more depressed crave more addictive substances\n\nlike more alcohol more coffee more sugar and when we’re more alkaline which is going to occur when\n\nwe eat more green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits disease doesn’t really proliferate in that\n\ntype of condition so there’s all kinds of books and not every book agrees on what’s acid and alkaline\n\nbut in general we could say that sugar and dairy and meat and grains make us more acidic\n\nand when we’re more acidic we’re just going to be more likely to get that cold that flu be one of\n\nthose people that gets cancer whereas if we’re more alkaline we’re going to regenerate and\n\nfeel brighter and more alive so it’s a real simple thing and of course it’s changes from day to day\n\nyou know if you test yourself and you’re more acid it could be that you had a big dessert last night\n\nor you drank three cups of coffee instead of one so it does change from day to day but it also\n\ngives you ideas on well how do I get back on track because so many medical tests they do change\n\nfrom day to day so we have control and what I’m trying to do with herbal medicine is really\n\nempower people to take more responsibility for their own health rather than yes it’s great that you\n\nhave a wonderful doctor I’m so happy for you but he’s not making food for you three meals a day\n\nunless you’re married to him or her so it’s really up to you what can you do to make this easier and\n\nso I like to empower people to be their their primary health care person and then everything\n\nelse’s secondary interciary and it’s such a beautiful way to put this I have recently been\n\nsharing with folks that in a sense each one of us is a farmer and we each have a farm in the form\n\nof our body where we’re growing all kinds of organisms and some of them are good for us some of\n\nthem not and I’ve heard that as we keep our bodies more alkaline it actually means that the\n\nconditions the environments inside of us are not as favorable for some of those pathogens that\n\nmight make us sick well it’s interesting that Louis past year who’s who promoted pasteurization\n\nwhere we have to heed everything to keep it sterile and you know constantly be using antimicrobial\n\nagents at the end of his life he said the terrain is everything the terrain is everything the earth\n\nso it’s not just about like well I shook someone’s hand and they had it cold because we’re always\n\nexposed to pathogens all day long every time we get close to somebody shake hands hug and brace\n\nshare you know a cup pick up a pencil that someone else had and so rather than thinking oh it’s\n\nthe pathogens that must all be annihilated because it’s not possible there are good bacteria and\n\nbad bacteria and so if we have a healthy strong terrain then we’re going to be able to\n\nfight off the things that don’t serve us oh I love it well it turns out we’re talking about soil\n\nagain there you go all this it’s so important when you mentioned the leafy greens one of the things\n\nthat made me think of is is learning a while back in Brigitte I think I’ve may have first heard\n\nthis from you that the chlorophyll in green plants which is the molecule that allows the conversion\n\nof sunlight into usable molecules that essentially feeds our biosphere that chlorophyll molecule\n\nis identical to the hemoglobin molecule that is in our blood with one difference that at the hemoglobin\n\nmolecules center there is an iron atom and in the center of the chlorophyll molecule is a magnesium\n\natom oh my gosh it’s as if we’re in the same family that’s true and you could think of chlorophyll\n\nas being like plant blood and we also know that chlorophyll which we’re going to find in everything\n\nfrom kale to spinach to arugula to dandelion greens helps our bodies not only to be more alkaline\n\nbut also to better utilize oxygen and to help wound healing time and help us to be more resistant\n\nto infection so even though I really think eat all the colors there’s something especially\n\nmedicinal about the green plants and you know all of the we also know that the green plants of\n\nour planet are also providing oxygen for us to breathe and that’s why you know I feel so strongly\n\nthat we should all be growing something rather than just having a rock yard you know plant\n\nsomething to help oxygenate our cities because this is where we really need it absolutely well\n\nspeaking of the cities it seems to me that if we’re going to get more and more focused on this idea\n\nof having space colonies or living on the moon or on Mars or something like that I know this is a\n\ndiscussion emerging more and more it strikes me that by golly if we’re going to be terraforming\n\nsome of these utterly hostile environments why don’t we practice and terraform the cities we’ve\n\ngot now because they are actually pretty harsh environments also and it’s basically going to boil\n\ndown to soil and growing these plants whether we’re in a high rise apartment or a suburban\n\nhome with a yard we could be growing all manner of medicinal herbs couldn’t we?\n\nAbsolutely I have an article that was on Huffington Post and it’s now online it’s called Get\n\nOff Your Grass and Create an Edible Lawn and you know the idea that we are spending a third of\n\nour nation’s water supply to water grass which is a crop that most humans don’t eat maybe your pet\n\ngoat does but you know how many of us have a pet goat in the yard I don’t think too many\n\nbut we’re wasting our water and we can’t continue to to disrespect water\n\nright especially the way the population has increased and what if that same amount of water or even\n\na fraction of that amount of water was used to grow things like chickweed and dandelion and malva\n\nand personally which was Gandhi’s favorite food so there’s been this American thought that like\n\nweeds are the enemy and you’re not a good citizen if you have dandelions in your yard and yet\n\ndandelions help aerate the soil the leaves are edible the flowers are high in luteine which benefits\n\nour eyes farmers have long said that where the dandelions grow that’s a great place to put the garden\n\nso we need to change our thinking that spring herbicides is an American way of life because\n\nthat is bad even if you think you’re only spraying your yard the rain the winds it ends up migrating\n\nit ends up killing the bees and the bees pollinate I’ve heard like three out of every four bites of\n\nfood we eat millions of dollars worth every year and so we cannot continue this practice and we\n\nknow that there’s some really you know maybe we thought this was a good idea I mean I grew up\n\nduring the better living through chemistry slogan but we’re needing to rethink that and you know\n\nanything with the words side in it herbicide pesticide we do not need to be spraying that in our\n\nyard where our children play our pets cohort and and to rethink the way we look at the weeds because\n\nI made breakfast this morning and everything that was in our breakfast was growing five minutes\n\nbefore we were eating it I harvested kale and what was left of the dandelion greens and the\n\nvitality you feel for meeting things that are so fresh they were just growing you can’t buy that\n\nat the store right and I really think we’ve been bamboozles you know everything we buy and eat\n\nit’s gonna have a bar code and a sticker on it and so I’m really advocating like what can you plant\n\nwhat can you grow we can all grow something that’s so beautiful so beautiful so maybe we’ll we’ll\n\nstart planting the seeds for a a no-code movement around some of these things that we’re eating\n\nyou know I remember hearing recently that in some of our ancient traditions we actually have\n\nawareness of the degree of life force in food called prana for example and the fact that you’re\n\noften eating plants that were just growing a few minutes prior means that there is a much higher\n\nlevel of prana in life force which is driving our health and well-being isn’t it it’s so true\n\nand if you think about it how many people are buying iceberg lettuce that’s trucked in from another\n\ncountry or another state although in the winter it might be trucked in from another continent\n\nand how long ago was that plant in the ground and so I’ve heard bringing iceberg lettuce from\n\nCalifornia is a very expensive way to ship water right and so you know again the darker chlorophyll\n\nis going to indicate even more minerals so if you’re eating some kind of white green rather than\n\nlike something dark and rich you’re you’re missing out and we just it’s just a shift in consciousness\n\nin this we’re all helping that and we’re all here for you to help you shift and we just need to\n\nreeducate our neighbors but when you see those pesticides applied sign like that that cannot be\n\nthe good neighbor the future it’s not and housing associations and homeowners associations they\n\nneed to change their strategies because anything that’s contributing to the destruction of our bees\n\nand our soil and our water and our air that’s not for the benefit of humankind absolutely\n\nand Brigitte just to that end and on that note I want to mention for our viewers and audience\n\nthat with respect to engaging in these practices for greater stewardship sustainability health\n\nand well-being there are incredible resources available including the 14 books that Brigitte has\n\nwritten and you can find those at BrigitteMars.com it’s b-r-i-g-i-t-t-e-m-a-r-s.com\n\nand I’ll just drop a little something in there for the esotericists out there you might be\n\ninterested to note that the plant nettles according to Rudolph Steiner had an affiliation with the\n\nplanet Mars and you’ll see on the tree of life the Kabbalah some very interesting things to check\n\nout there if you are so inclined. I also want to mention that if you would like to you can use\n\nthe code podcast to get discounts on the audiobook and ebook resources at yhonner.org slash market\n\nso that’s something that we want to make sure you guys use however there is also a very special\n\ncode you can use if you would like to which is BrigitteMars and if you use that special code\n\nBrigitteMars at the yhonner website you’ll get discounts on products and some other\n\nnifty goodies so we want to make sure you know about that and I just want to come back now to\n\nthe dandelion for another moment because one of the things that in all these different\n\nplants growing in our neighborhoods maybe in our yards that some of us might have been\n\napplying pesticides to dandelion in particular is an essential early spring food for the honeybees\n\nand they are so essential to our ecosystem tell us a little more about that and taking care of\n\nhoneybees and dandelions and all of that well the dandelions were deliberately brought here\n\nby the pioneers they planted them because dandelions are one of the top five most nutritious\n\nvegetables and the pioneers put fences around the dandelions you know just like with everything\n\nelse to keep the deer and the rabbit and other creatures out because that was a food plant and\n\ndandelion leaves are edible in the Jewish tradition they were originally one of the bitter herbs\n\nof Passover the dandelion stems you can boil like noodles the flowers are edible I’ve made dandelion\n\nsmoothies dandelion loaf I have a whole e-book out called dandelion medicine so I’m going to\n\nmaybe mention that check that out and dandelion root is also edible and it helps to detoxify the\n\nliver it’s good for skin ailments so how did this plant ever get so maligned like it’s such a great\n\nplant and again I think it’s a lot of marketing that we’re being sold a bill that says you know\n\nyou need to get these chemicals and have this antiseptic pea green lawn I feel like it’s an\n\noppression of the wild and the feminine yes we need to control and dominate nature and keep\n\ngiving her like a crew cut all the time and that sells more gasoline doesn’t it\n\nbillions of gallons of gasoline per year to mow lawns and and it’s really toxic it smells bad like\n\nhere you are trying to sleep in maybe a little bit Sunday morning and seven o’clock you know\n\nso maybe we should think about how we do our lawns but the dandelion is so useful\n\nyou can roast the root and it tastes a lot like coffee it’s a great herb medicinally it’s as I\n\nsaid it’s also alkalinating like the nettles are and this whole idea that dandelions somehow\n\nindicate that you’re a low-class citizen or something I think that really came from a sort of\n\nprejudice against foreigners you know like hey it’s American American shop at the store and they\n\nbuy new modern food boiling a bag kind of vegetables and prepackaged food so it’s you know again\n\nwe’re all doing our best and we’re all very influenced by the median that’s why it’s so important\n\nto do a show like this to really say the dandelions are not the enemy maybe we really need to think\n\nabout these chemicals that are poisoning our planet but dandelions are so useful and not only to\n\nhumans but for the soil because they aerate the soil they make nutrients more available for\n\nother plants and you know we were talking about plants that adapt the dandelion adapts it survives\n\npeople walking on it it survives dogs peeing on it it can grow through the cracks in the sidewalks\n\nit it grows before the snows are even you know complete it can survive all kinds of adversity they\n\ntried to kill it tried to kill it it keeps shape shifting ever so little you mow it down and it\n\njust goes back shorter next season so talk about adaptogens they don’t have to come from\n\nSiberia or Iceland we’ve got adaptogens saying use me use me lots I’m right here you know and I\n\nfeel like the dandelion really is a symbol of this realigning with nature and becoming a partner\n\nwith nature and all those seeds that proliferate I mean this plant it’s doing great things and I\n\nthink a lawn with dandelions in it is so much more interesting for our kids to play and you could\n\nmake a wish and blow those little seeds around and yeah it’s delightful that way and it strikes me\n\nthat these plants dandelion are so resilient persistent intelligent adaptable reminds me a lot of\n\nour species and in a sense connecting with the dandelion for each of us is an opportunity to\n\nconnect back more with our own heritages and the longer versions of our human story on the planet\n\nthat sounds like to me a lot of fun and you know the the French called dandelion peace on Lee which\n\nmeans pee in the bed because dandelion is a diuretic and it’s as effective a diuretic as one of\n\nthe leading diuretic drugs well why aren’t the studies being done on dandelion and another thing\n\nabout those leading drugs is they deplete your body of potassium so a good doctor will say here’s\n\nthis drug now go get some potassium but dandelions give you potassium but who’s going to you know\n\nrelease dandelion is a drug when they’ve got us buying chemicals to eradicate them it’s a bit\n\nnefarious in my opinion so we just need to come on everybody wake up we’re here to help\n\nyeah and the nature nature is like offering you something free that’s going to help you adapt\n\nyeah well I just believe and and and so overjoyed every day that we live on this miraculous planet\n\nBrigitte and there’s there’s no accident that we refer to this planet as a mother mother earth\n\nGaia in traditions all over the world and speaking of the relationship with the feminine and with\n\nnature there’s another very special plant that I’ve heard you speak about before which is the\n\nhemp plant the canning bosom and I’ve heard you talk about this plant as the great mother\n\nthis is a plant that has extraordinary healing properties for ourselves for the landscapes and\n\necosystems and it’s amazing to watch right now that this plant is suddenly transforming back into\n\na central part of our way of being here in this culture that change is happening and so good\n\nby golly it’s something we need to see more and more of and Brigitte why is this hemp plant\n\none of your favorites well I’m always looking for plants that can help the planet and when I think\n\nabout hemp here’s a plant that we could be making fuel out of that’s renewable rather than fracking\n\nour neighborhoods that one really makes me mad we could be making fabric out of hemp right now one\n\nof the most pesticide crops on the face of the earth is cotton and since it’s not a food crop\n\nthere’s no restrictions on how many sprays can be used on it so most cotton is really toxic and\n\nreally creating a toxic condition for the soil very often peanuts are crop rotated with cotton\n\nwhich makes peanuts somewhat questionable too in their safety if they’re not organic\n\nwe also know that hemp could be used to make homes and make fireproof homes that are breathable\n\nso that’s another product we are cutting down old growth forests to make newspapers\n\ntrees that take you know decades to grow whereas hemp were used in three to four months three to\n\nfour months three to four months okay and not to mention that hemp seed provides a food it’s the\n\nsecond highest source of vegetable protein next to soybeans but it’s much easier to digest\n\nso we could be using hemp seed to make hemp milk and a protein protein powder we could be using\n\nit as a nut in seed and not to mention all of the medicinal properties that are being found and\n\nhave long been known as medicine that many of the components in hemp whether it be CBD, THC\n\nand so on and so forth have been used to compings like anxiety and help sleep reduce inflammation\n\nand so this plant has really been persecuted and prosecuted for many years and yet this is\n\na plant that can solve many many of the problems on our planet and I’m not saying that everybody needs\n\nto smoke cannabis but we know that Henry Ford built a car out of hemp and it was fueled on hemp\n\nand it’s stronger than steel it can resist impact more than steel think of how many minerals\n\nwere extracting from the earth when it could all be done above ground with a minimal amount of\n\npollution so when I think of a plant that could really save the world I’m going to say hemp can\n\nsave the world and it’s also interesting that we actually have a system in our bodies called the\n\nendocannabinoid system that somehow our bodies seem to have evolved with this plant and you know as\n\nyou mentioned in the Bible they talk about the holding anointing oil that is mentioned in the\n\nOld Testament that it was made from olive oil cinnamon, mer and cany bosom and in translation,\n\na Greek translation in the septugiate I hope I pronounced that right in the 3rd century BC they\n\ntranslated the cany bosom to be calimus a chorus calimus which is probably not the plant that was\n\nused in the holy anointing oil it doesn’t have the same medicinal benefits and the Bible also refers\n\nto cany as a fiber plant and calimus is not a fiber plant so there’s a lot of scholars,\n\nbotanists, rabbis you know priests who are saying hey it’s not a chorus calimus so that’s a huge\n\nmisstep and yet even though the cannabis plant is legal in many states it’s still in prison in the\n\nsense there’s this female plants that are being grown indoors with electricity and floridated water\n\nand so I really feel to move into this age of regeneration and healing the planet that we’re\n\ngoing to have to free the plant and let it grow outdoors with sunlight and wind and I know that’s\n\ngoing to really shape shift the economy but what if there was free food and fiber growing everywhere\n\nfor people and one other thing about hemp that you often don’t hear about is it grows very tall\n\nand it produces seeds that the birds could be eating in the winter which encourages the birds\n\nto nest nearby and then the birds help you by eating more insects in the warmer months so it\n\nreally is a plant that could help not to mention that the leaves provide fertilizer that it is one\n\nof the most ancient fiber crops that grows as tall as a tree in one season it’s pretty remarkable\n\nand again I realize that we’re turning it into a drug and I don’t know if that’s really that’s\n\na whole another discussion but when I think of all the environmental concerns that we have\n\nhere there’s one plant that could do so many things it’s interesting I’m hearing more and more\n\ncommercial farmers are now incorporating hemp into their production cycles because it is actually\n\nhelping their economics and allowing them to get away from a lot of the chemical inputs that\n\nthey’ve been using and we’re hearing more and more farmers farmers growing 20, 30,000 acres of\n\nthings like wheat and hay out in places like Utah who are now making the switch back to organic\n\nbecause of course organics not a fad right this is what we’ve been doing for hundreds and thousands\n\nof years it’s only the last couple generations we’ve been conducting this experiment and so many\n\nof these conventional farmers several of them are fifth sixth generation are converting back to\n\norganic and incorporating hemp into their production cycles and it’s doing amazing things for\n\ntheir viability as small family businesses and you know even here in the state of Colorado where we\n\nlegalize cannabis a few years ago it is good for the economy it’s bringing not only tourism but\n\nthere’s many places people that are employed in this industry and you know there’s a there’s a lot\n\nof good there’s a lot of creativity going on and but I’m always into education about plants and I’m\n\ncertainly not condoning being abusive with anything I think with every plant we need to learn\n\nwhat its functions are when it’s appropriate to use it I certainly wouldn’t use golden seedle every\n\nday yeah well speaking of abusing plants you know I’ve shared that I’m I’m part Native American\n\nMohawk Indian and of course tobacco is this incredibly sacred plant to many of the quote-unquote\n\nnew world tribal peoples and I was addicted to tobacco smoking cigarettes for many many years I\n\nstarted as a teenager as a lot of people do and then it was about 12 or so years ago that I\n\nfinally quit and Brigitte I’m just I’m really curious I think more and more of us are waking up\n\nto the role of addiction in our lives and what we can do proactively to overcome some of those\n\npatterns and what what are some of the essential insights and even recommendations that you make\n\nin your book that deals with addiction if you if you could share with us about that surely well\n\nI wrote a book called addiction free naturally because I think very often in our quest to get well\n\nif we don’t address the things like we’re drinking too much coffee eating too much sugar still\n\nsmoking still drinking you maybe even a prescription drug we could be undermining our health and all\n\nthe supplements and herbs and yoga is not going to help us to achieve balance so one thing I think\n\nwould be very helpful is to bring back the art of doing handicrafts with our hands if we were\n\nto go back to our ancestry you know the men and women were doing things with wood and metal with\n\nfiber with fabric maybe the women were inside making a quilt or knitting socks and the men were\n\nout on the porch making you know knife handles or cradle boards or or something rocking chairs\n\nor something like that and so it seems like we let go of doing things with our hands and\n\nmaking things with your hands is good for your self esteem and you create things of beauty that\n\nhave lasting value I mean if I make a quilt for my children it’s not going to end up in a yard\n\nsale that’s like an heirloom and it’s made with you know mama love or pop a love and I and\n\nsketching could be a craft playing an instrument rather than just listening to music like doing\n\nsomething with our hands and we also know that we need to find other ways to reward ourself\n\nso rather than thinking oh I was really good today I deserve a drink or I deserve a smoke\n\nand again I know the tobacco can be used in ceremony and celebration in a in a sacred way\n\nI use it I was a tobacco smoker myself for years that what are other ways to reward ourself\n\nmaybe reading a novel reading a magazine calling a friend on the telephone yeah maybe going\n\nfor a walk um you know doing yoga spending time in the garden so it’s so those are just a few\n\nthings but we also know that being more alkaline and eating those green leafy vegetables can make\n\nus more you know able to stay on track and not over indulge in anything that undermines our health\n\nI love it it’s um there are so many pathways to enhanced health and well-being and on the\n\ntopic of making things with our hands you know of course Gandhi really emphasized this notion\n\nof Swadeshi how important it is for us to be able to make things in our own homes in our own\n\ncommunities and I’m struck that our word man new facture comes from the Latin monos for hand\n\nand facto to make so manufacture means to make by hand and uh or at least that’s the origin\n\nthe etymology of our word um and I’m struck that one of the as you were describing this one of the\n\nthings I love making by hand as you know are these um hemp infused bathing salts that I’ve been\n\nmaking to share with people love them waylay waters and we actually I started doing this about a\n\nyear ago in part because of the classes I was taking from you Brigitte and I was creating these\n\ndifferent aroma therapy blends with a hemp infused base organic coconut oil I was sharing them\n\nwith friends and family and then suddenly I was hearing from people hey can I get some more that\n\nit helped with my back or with my arthritis or I’ve been able to cut back on my sleeping medication\n\nmy goodness and uh realized um we were uh talking with Artem and uh realized my gosh this might be\n\na little cottage industry thing we could do uh to help support the work at the Y on earth community\n\nand so for me to be able to sit there for a few hours and make a batch the level of joy and peace\n\nand really tranquility I feel during and after that process is remarkable and it’s like\n\nwhat a gift and here here we’re just making things to share with people um I I don’t know\n\nBrigitte I think you’ve hit on something there that could be a whole another uh topic of discussion\n\neven perhaps in addition to what we might do with our relationship with plants and herbal medicine\n\nin terms of helping heal our planet and ourselves this uh working with our hands seems really important\n\nit’s so simple and I also think that not working with our hands is another contributing factor to\n\nlosing our mental faculties because there’s a big connection between the hands and the brains so\n\nit’s also a great stress relieving technique but we also know that um many people that have\n\naddictive tendencies have blood sugar issues and eating things like drinking lots of fruit juice\n\nand eating whiteflower products and sugar can also make us be in that loop of uh stimulate\n\nsedate stimulate sedate so using herbs like cinnamon and fennel and anus and there’s a lot of\n\nthings that we can do to help addiction rather than just you know only use willpower yes yes\n\nyeah that’s so important Brigitte I am so uh humbled and overjoyed to have this time with you\n\nand I know you have been teaching hundreds thousands of people uh in our community around here\n\nand all around the world and uh you are in my humble opinion a living treasure
