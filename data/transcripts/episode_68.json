(This framework was first shared by Dr. Jandel Allen-Davis in Podcast episode #30).",

Today I’m here with Artem Nicholkov and we are\n\ncoming at you with a special coronavirus episode and you may remember Artem from a previous\n\npodcast episode, in fact episode number 31, where we talked about digital media and communication\n\ntechnologies enabling our sustainability efforts around the world. So just to remind you, Artem is\n\none of the global advisory board members of the Y Honors Community and is also the founder and\n\nCEO of Earth Coast Productions which does media and video production work for all kinds of\n\ncompanies and organizations doing great things in terms of sustainability, social enterprise, etc.\n\nWe’ll talk more about that but we’re here out in the woods outside of Boulder and this is the\n\nfirst the beginning of the first week of voluntary lockdown in the United States because of\n\ncoronavirus and we thought we’d share a bunch of things with you in terms of what we’re up to\n\nand how we’re navigating these uncharted waters and so Artem I’m really grateful we could get\n\ntogether and share this time and hopefully share a few insights with folks. Yeah it’s an honor\n\nto be here and thanks for inviting me back on the podcast and it’s always good to be in front of\n\nof the camera. A lot of times we’re editing the other episodes and kind of behind the camera\n\non a lot of these things so it’s always good to be in front of the camera and get any chance to\n\nspeak and we’re obviously living through uncertain times with this COVID-19, the novel virus, novel\n\ncoronavirus and it’s novel in it’s you know chemical makeup and its structure it’s unknown to\n\nthe medical community, the biological community and I think it’s interesting that you know novelty\n\nand uncertainty are so close really related but one could be coming from a place of curiosity\n\nand just a place of trying to understand something new and the other more from a place of anxiety\n\nand anxiousness and just like uncertainty and instability and so you kind of have these two\n\npaths that that birds there so I find that interesting to consider and in thinking about that\n\nhow we react to it is so important taking the time to take stock in our own being of where we’re\n\nat and what we’re doing how we’re reacting how we’re supporting our friends and family and loved\n\nones through this time and it’s just so critical to remember that why we’re here and how we’re\n\nconnecting with one another even if we are in the time of social distancing and you know videos\n\nspecialty live videos certainly a wonderful way to continue our somewhat normal day-to-day operations\n\nso I think for people right now it’s important to just really pause and be grounded and you know\n\ntake a breath first and foremost and yeah really feel into your own being\n\nand where you sit where you spend the night the people that you are in direct contact with\n\nif you’re living with someone or if you’re by yourself but just really taking stock of all\n\nof those things knowing that that’s your kind of current bubble and supporting that so that you\n\ncan then support others who are outside of that circle at the moment and there are some really\n\nwonderful ways that we can continue to stay engaged and continue to create art and continue to\n\nstay inspired and be inspired and to create from that space all of those perhaps unfinished projects\n\nthat we’ve been dreaming into our lives this is a wonderful opportunity to work on that and also\n\nto reach out to people who are also stuck in their own little bubbles somewhere and we have\n\nfortunately the digital means to continue the conversation and to invite others to collaborate\n\nin our work and I just find that so wonderful I know you and I have been meeting as well and\n\njust discussing things that are going on in our personal lives as friends and how powerful that is\n\nand over this next week we might need to do that virtually as well.\n\nYes yeah yeah brings up so many opportunities I think and I don’t know if the microphones are\n\npicking them up well that we can hear a lot of birds singing around us and one of our\n\nhashtag ideas over the last couple days has been spring is not canceled and truly although our\n\nhuman systems our economic systems are considerably disrupted at the moment the rest of the\n\nliving biosphere on this planet is going through its ordinary seasonal cycles and here in the\n\nnorthern hemisphere where most of us humans live there is a changing from winter to spring underway\n\nand I think that in all of this is some silver lining to deepen our connection to that\n\nreality of living here on planet earth and we’ve got a lot of fun things to share with you I’m\n\nsuper excited we actually have Artem mentioned our creativity and generative endeavors we’ve\n\ngot a few things in that area to share with you and thought that it might be a nice way to frame\n\nall of this to borrow a concept that we first heard about from Dr. Jandell Allen Davis who\n\nactually was on podcast episode number 30 if you want to check that out and she was talking about\n\nVUCA VUCA and VUCA prime and VUCA is when we’re characterizing situations or systems as being marked\n\nby volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity and obviously those conditions those attributes\n\ncan cause heightened anxiety certainly trigger fear response mechanisms in our nervous system\n\nand so there’s there’s an antidote there’s there’s a flip side to that coin called VUCA prime\n\nand that stands for vision understanding the sea is I got to look clarity that’s it and agility\n\nand so Dr. Allen Davis has a beautiful discussion about that in podcast episode number 30\n\nand it I think gives us a wonderful relatively simple framework to think about how we’re\n\ncultivating those those latter four vision understanding clarity and agility in a way that\n\nenhances our own individual effectiveness of course our quality of life and also helps us to\n\nbecome sources of strength stability and sensibility in our communities when we’re going through\n\nthese kinds of challenges together absolutely yeah and understanding that we are not trying to\n\npush away or ignore the volatility and the uncertainty and the complexity and the ambiguity of\n\nthe situation at hand because everything around COVID-19 and the current economic impacts that\n\nthat’s having and the social repercussions that we’re all feeling as part of this that is all\n\nthere and so I think that they really do go in hand it’s not you know VUCA or VUCA prime it’s\n\nreally both and knowing that the the first VUCA of volatility and uncertainty is really the\n\nouter that we don’t necessarily have control over but the VUCA prime is something that we have\n\ncomplete inner control over and how do we strengthen our selves mentally and physically and\n\ncertainly our immune system at this point to be in the best place to react with clarity to the\n\nambiguous situation at hand and I’m sure you can speak more on how what at least one of the\n\nways that people can take care of themselves and by taking care of yourself continuing to take\n\ncare of others in that as well yeah absolutely and so we’re going to share a handful of ideas and\n\nrecommendations and invitations with you all and in many respects we here over the last few days\n\nhave had a handful of strategy meetings and have essentially pivoted in this goes to that agility\n\npoint we’ve a pivoted a bit and have reprioritized some of our projects and campaigns because of COVID-19\n\nso one of the things that we’re really emphasizing is the importance of our own self-care in these times\n\nwe know that keeping our stress levels low corresponds and correlates to keeping our immune systems\n\nstrong and of course being outside is one of the strategies that we have to keep our stress levels\n\nlow and we have some others we’ll share one in particular is that with the Waylay Waters CBD\n\naroma therapy soaking salts basically if you’re at home and going to be at home for several days\n\nwhat you can do is order some of the Waylay Waters soaking salts and create a home spa experience for\n\nyourself not only do the salts themselves have de-stressing properties of course the CBD\n\nhemp is is an amazing plant medicine for us with phytonutrients that contribute to health\n\nand well-being in a multiple of ways and then the the aroma therapy on top of that the essential\n\noils that we’ve selected in the five different blends basically further help with antimicrobial\n\nattributes and additional stress relief attributes there’s even a lavender blend for example and\n\nbrought the the jars here just so we can show folks and so yeah here’s lavender\n\nhere’s aphrodisiac right if you’re home with your honey hey take a bath together\n\nwhat a great opportunity to deepen into your intimacy together there’s a eucalyptus right kind\n\nof a nice standard standby we know eucalyptus is helpful with lung ailments so if you’re\n\nfeeling a little bit of symptomatic stuff going on with your lungs eucalyptus can be helpful\n\nrosemary and pine is my most favorite this one is absolutely brings you into the experience of\n\nforest whether you’re in a big city or out in the remote area this is such an exquisite\n\npiece and we know that rosemary and pine have special healing attributes as well and then there’s\n\nthe moontime blend which is the geranium and neroli and it’s especially formulated for women going\n\nthrough their menstrual cycle but it’s it’s just a wonderful blend that any of us can use at any\n\ntime and and has some really nice relaxing and healing attributes there so with wheylay waters we\n\nhave a monthly grip giving program and you can make a donation at three levels 33 dollars 88\n\ndollars or 133 dollars to the YonEarth community which is a nonprofit and you’ll receive monthly\n\nshipments of either one three or five of these jars each jar is enough for two baths right so that’s\n\ntwo six or ten baths per month and those proceeds are helping all of our community mobilization\n\nclimate action soil regeneration culture of kindness work and one of the things that we’ve\n\naccelerated is the launch of our CBD hump infused sabs and so we’ve got soothe which is in the\n\norganic coconut oil base we’ve got frost which is a menthol winter green essential oil piece\n\nkind of like a icy hot and then we’ve got sweet heat which is the sensual afridiziac\n\nsav that you can use as a massage oil with your honey and so we’re going to accelerate as a\n\nresult of all of this getting these products available within the very near term the next\n\nweek or so and for the first ten folks who join our monthly giving program for the soaking salts\n\nwe will give you one of these tins for free whichever of the three you want to try out then we’re\n\nhappy to get that to you and that is another way to help with our stress relief aches and pains\n\nall that kind of stuff so so that’s one of the ways we’ve pivoted in waylay waters is one of the\n\nsocial enterprise companies that YonEarth is partnered with and all the proceeds go to supporting\n\nthe work of the YonEarth community so we’re really excited about that kind of ecosystem and\n\nwe’ll talk a little more about some of the others that are coming down the pipeline as well in our\n\nsocial enterprise work but yeah that that home wellness and personal care is even more important\n\nin these times right and we have some some wonderful offerings to share with folks yeah in a major\n\nway taking care of one’s body and just feeling present truly present for yourself so you can\n\nbe present for others is so vital I know for me taking a really waters bath so is such a truly\n\nretreat at you know at the house it’s something that really is creating this that spy experience and\n\nwhen you set yourself up for for that you know for me it’s you know getting a book out and candles\n\nand setting up obviously a bath tub full of hot water it’s such a wonderful experience and\n\nbeing able to ground into that that all of these other realms of human experience are still\n\navailable like human experience isn’t canceled and certainly spring isn’t canceled either and so\n\nthat that’s something that’s really important right now you know take a bath so do yoga do\n\narts connect with people that you can collaborate with work on those projects that you haven’t\n\nyou know really picked up in a while or that you are working on and are really looking forward to\n\ncompleting it’s a wonderful time for that and as far as coming back to the hashtag of springs is\n\nnot canceled you know planting gardens and planting your own garden and growing your own food\n\nright now is the prime time to be getting the seedlings going and working with biodynamics\n\nand getting some of the prep for the seedlings and placing it in the garden as well\n\num that’s something that you can do and really lead the way and and show to your neighbors as well\n\nwho might be cooped up in their apartments or homes that their life continues spring is not\n\ncanceled the birds are chirping and we can be planting your own food especially when you know you\n\ngo to the grocery store and there’s not even enough ingredients to put a salad together\n\nbananas are sold out you know all these things are just kind of off the shelves and so\n\nit really causes you to pause and think you know how do we structure more resiliency\n\ninto our community into our everyday life and how do we really create that this future of\n\ncommunity where we get to share the abundance that is truly available to us on this planet\n\nand um it’s it’s not a space limitation I mean you can grow a small herb garden and some tomatoes\n\nand peppers on a windowsill in an apartment and I’ve actually recently seen a really cool\n\nvideo of how someone has created a complete aquaponics system inside of their uh New York\n\napartment I mean this is in a high-rise building there’s not a patch of soil anywhere and they\n\njust have a full functioning aquaponics system with an herb garden I mean it’s it’s just wonderful\n\nto see and so it really um just goes to show that it’s not a limitation of you know space but it’s\n\nan application of our creativity and um also an application you know of uh the the mother of creation\n\nis necessity um and that other mother of invention rather uh but also follow through in a certain\n\nway like getting those projects really activated is this is the primary time uh to be doing that\n\nand again leading the way in um communicating with your friends and family about how you can do that\n\nand finding the support that you need not the least of which is the line-earth community um there’s\n\na wonderful network of line-earth ambassadors who would be more than happy to offer suggestions\n\nand uh offer guidance and uh other tips and resources on how to grow your own food and\n\nhow to really uh implement these things whether you have a patch of dirt accessible to you in your\n\ncondo uh plaques or uh an apartment building or you’re fortunate enough to have a yard\n\nyeah it’s uh there’s there’s so much um that you’re hitting on Artem that I I’m really excited\n\nabout and uh feel this uh increasing surge of energy it reminds me of of that transition from winter\n\nto spring and uh you know one of the things that we’re working on um and we’ll have available\n\npretty soon is a new social enterprise called soil works where we’re putting together a biodynamic\n\nsoil amendment wrapped in almost like a bath bomb for your garden or your yard um in a\n\nmagnesium sulfate sphere that you can stir into water and it’s this kind of fun fusion way\n\nof approaching biodynamics that gets those uh probiotics into the soil into the landscape\n\nand uh that’s that’s one of the things we’re accelerating now on our timeline in terms of our\n\n2020 action plan and uh you can find the 2020 action plan on the yonors.org website in the community\n\nsection uh right toward the top there is the page called action plan and you’ll see a little\n\nmention of soil works and there what we’re doing with soil works is collaborating with a handful of\n\nbiodynamic farms situated all around North America and making these very special\n\norganic compost land medicine applications available and you can use these not only in your in your\n\nyards and gardens if you’re so fortunate to have those but also in your potted house plants\n\ninside and I want to be sure to mention that we did a podcast episode with Brigitte Mars the preeminent\n\nherbalist and author on herbal medicine that’s podcast episode number 19 and in there the main\n\ntheme and topic of the discussion was herbal medicine for our stress management practices\n\nof course I recall her mentioning the three key herbs for health and well-being are\n\ndandelion nettles and hemp and again back to the way they waters right we got that covered for you\n\ndandelion its springtime dandelion will be popping up here soon and of course the last thing we\n\nwant to do is spray those with poison uh we want to leave some of those flowers growing for the bees\n\nit’s some of the earliest uh bee food in the springtime and then we can also uh eat some of those\n\nflowers and leaves and later on roots and incredible immune boosting properties that come from\n\nthese dandelions and of course nettles are a very dynamic accumulator uh herbaceous species\n\nthat have high levels of iron and all sorts of other vitamins and nutrients that boost fortify\n\nour immune systems so uh definitely check out podcast episode 19 with Brigitte Mars because she\n\nshe gives so many wonderful uh pointers and suggestions that we can uh be practicing day in and\n\nand day out and and yeah I just want to really uh sort of double down on this emphasis on the\n\nthe soil and the planting and we even brought a little uh bowl of soil here you know when we get\n\nour hands uh directly engaged with the uh living soil we’re interacting with all of the\n\nbeneficial microbes that boost our immune system we their science uh now showing the uh\n\nrelationship there uh not to mention that interacting with those uh soil uh micro organisms\n\nis also going to boost our serotonin production right it’s also going to help us feel a bit lighter\n\nand and more joyful and less stressed and uh you know we talk about that quite a bit in our\n\nour soil stewardship handbook and several of the podcast episodes where we’re talking with farmers\n\nand gardeners and so on but um this opportunity we have right now with the approaching spring\n\nto to really double and triple down quintuple down on our uh connecting with soil uh it’s actually\n\ngoing to help boost boost our immune system and help our our day-to-day quality of life\n\nabsolutely yeah and being able to grow your own food however um much it’s still augments um\n\nthe actual purchases that you have to make at the store um so there that that helps you out\n\neconomically that way and also you know the quality of the food is so much better when you grow it\n\nand stay straight from the land um and it also connects you with the soil i mean um you know if\n\nif you don’t have a soil practice in terms of uh touching and grounding soil every day uh gardening\n\ncreates that for you it creates that space to have essentially uh soil meditation\n\nuh as part of your life and um it’s something that’s so unique and we all need it we all need it\n\ni mean we all need to walk barefoot on on grass and natural forest floors uh obviously as the\n\nweather warms up that’s going to be a lot easier to do and uh physically touching soil and working\n\nwith the earth is something that reminds us of how connected we are to this planet and the things\n\nthat truly matter and the things that are um a constant the changing of the seasons you would\n\nknow there’s all kinds of things that are shifting um in that as part of um global climate change\n\nwe can still rely on the seasons uh being here on the birds showing up in the spring and uh singing\n\nbeautiful birdsong there’s a cute guy flying around off camera there yeah um and\n\nyou know global markets will rise and they’ll fall and all kinds of changes will happen and um\n\npolitical figures will be at the seat of power and another day they won’t and um you might\n\nagree with them you might disagree with them um but at the end of the day the things that we can\n\nrely on are the natural processes of this planet of this earth and um the nature that sustains us\n\nthe the large question is how do we integrate that into our modern lives um and how do we\n\nreally live in both of those worlds how do we uh grow a garden and um grow around food and\n\ntake care of really replenishing the soil and enriching the soil not depleting it\n\nmeanwhile being a technological heavily technological species and being\n\nable to track you know hashtag spring is not cancelled yeah on our wonderful uh smart devices here\n\nso um it really is a both uh approach and there is a wonderful way that we can scale our collaboration\n\nand the way that we communicate to our friends our family and to people that we have never met\n\nor would have never met without some of these uh digital technologies and platforms that are\n\navailable to us um and you know we’ve been in uh we’ve been using social media for a while now\n\nand all of these wonderful tools and i just didn’t invite everyone to in encourage everyone to\n\nuh participate in an encouraging way um and that that’s the other reason to take care of yourself\n\nand have a practice of well-being whether it’s uh you know physical practice or art and poetry\n\nor doing a soak in a bath uh those are all wonderful practices and the part of the reason to do that\n\nis so that you can stay centered uh when people do get into a comment or on online or whatever and\n\nyou can be um someone that offers a positive suggestion and offers a way forward of here’s what\n\nwe can be doing um and uh an example of that that uh directly relates to you know current\n\nCOVID-19 situation i was listening to um a podcast on blocks and they were sharing on\n\nthe latest situation in Italy and how the country’s essentially a complete lockdown\n\nand they uh the entire population is not really allowed to leave their homes with the exception of\n\ngoing to the grocery store or the pharmacy and even then it’s a regulated system so that there\n\naren’t too many people out on the streets or uh at a grocery store any one time so it’s a very\n\nchallenging situation to be uh living in and how there are communities with apartment buildings\n\nfor coming together and opening their windows into the courtyard and singing together\n\nyeah really um and it’s an example of how we can really create beautiful inspirational\n\nuh you know encouraging ways for ourselves to keep moving forward um because it doesn’t really\n\nserve anyone to be in free fat mode so being able to be that one person that stands up and\n\ndoes something different something that uh is grounded and centered is such a powerful catalyst\n\nwherever you are at whichever community you’re a part of uh and how wonderful it is to be\n\num that person uh or someone that joins a group of people that are already doing wonderful things\n\nyeah uh and participated in that way yeah speaking of that or to my want to be sure to um mention\n\nthe ambassador program just in case some of the audience might be interested in learning more about\n\nthat or becoming an ambassador um on the uh in the community section of the whyonder.org website\n\nyou’ll see a page called uh uh become an ambassador and the uh process to get involved and to engage\n\nand get activated is really straightforward um so want to just give a shout out to our ambassadors\n\nwho are located throughout Colorado throughout the United States and even in multiple countries\n\naround the world uh the work that you’re doing through your demonstrations your community gathering\n\nevents obviously not this week on the community gathering events but um all of that is the the\n\ncumulative uh efforts and gestures that are helping to transform our culture and uh as you\n\nwere talking in hardem about the combination of the communication technology the videos the social\n\nmedia and the connecting with soil and growing our own food uh it reminded me of this essay called\n\nthe meta-industrial village that we spoke about in our podcast i was realizing we recorded that\n\nabout a year ago um and and the meta-industrial village is an essay that was written by William\n\nIrwin Thompson when he was at MIT masters choose its institute of technology in the 70s and he was\n\nalready anticipating a future that would be marked by very robust global communication technologies\n\nand that that would be complemented by a deliberate returning to sort of localizing\n\nconnections with soil uh productions of food so forth and so on that create more resilient and\n\nsustainable uh supply chains and uh systems for our basic needs and so it just reminded me that\n\nthat’s a wonderful resource that i would encourage folks to track down um email us through the\n\nwebsite i do have a pdf of the essay i’d be happy to share um and uh it’s meta-industrial village\n\nin a collection of essays called darkness and scattered light by William Irwin Thompson\n\nand you know one of the other real silver linings in this very incredible challenge that we’re\n\nfacing is it’s forcing us to slow down a bit and one of the things one of the opportunities we\n\nhave when we’re slowing down a bit is to read uh more and i am a huge fan of reading not only\n\nfor uh it as a mechanism to learn new knowledge uh and potentially even gain some wisdom but i think\n\nit also does something in our mind and in our nervous system that helps us calm down and relax\n\nof it and i know you uh are holding a book here Artem and i thought you know maybe it’s an\n\nopportunity to share this one with our audience and i can share one that i just started a\n\nweek or two ago sure um well this is uh a book that Aaron has turned me on onto uh so thank you\n\nerin for that uh i just started reading it’s called the future of money by Bernard Littier and\n\nit is a really wonderful book on the four converging forces right now in our world and what’s\n\ninteresting about reading this book is that um it was written in mid 1990s and uh 2000 was\n\nsomething that was around the corner and 2020 was something that was in a distant future and\n\nthe way that the forces are really compounding between our technology um loss of biodiversity\n\nand climate change um the age wave uh that um he expounds on on the book in the book\n\nand uh these forces really shaping our society in a completely different way and being\n\naware of uh them in in the way that they are active and being able to shape our future in\n\nrelationship with money is such a powerful way to think and to also encourage to create\n\nlocal currencies um ways of bartering with each other in ways of uh exchanging value that\n\nis outside of um the modern economic system which is very fragile as um this current situation\n\nhighlights it yet again so the more that we can be committed to building resiliency in our communities\n\nin um the lives that we lead and the way that we change uh value um the better off we are\n\nand the more sustainable and more resilient of a world we’re building for ourselves and\n\nfuture generations so it’s um it’s a powerful book and what a wonderful opportunity to\n\nto read such uh tomes and in this time yeah this this book is one of my my favorites it really is\n\non my short list and uh the future of money um talks about four potential scenarios for the future\n\na couple of which are really beautiful and a couple of which are really scary and uh Bernard\n\nuh passed a year ago uh and was a friend of mine for many years and we uh several times had uh\n\ndinner and coffee and he always loved chocolate we would sit and have coffee and chocolate\n\ntogether talking about economics and money and sustainability and uh this book I highly recommend\n\nit and the way he put it together uh is wonderful it has lots of one or two page vignettes and lots of\n\nlittle sidebar um uh sides that that really help uh with the assimilation of the information that\n\nhe’s presenting and he was uh one of the uh economic technocrats who helped create the convergence\n\nmechanism when the various european nations were turning their national currencies into the euro\n\nso he has a very deep technical understanding of money the functions of money and it’s it’s just\n\nof wonderful reads so I do um uh recommend it to folks who are interested in that and as we’re\n\ngetting into things like crypto currency over time and how that might relate to sustainability efforts\n\nI think that Bernard probably has uh more wisdom and guidance to share than uh just about anybody\n\nhonestly on that topic um and so for any of you who might be interested in things like crypto currency\n\nI would say this is a must read actually um must read and uh so I’m also reading a novel by uh by\n\nGert one of my absolute favorite authors and thinkers he was has been referred to as the Shakespeare of\n\nGermany and um it’s called elective affinities in uh in english and translation and um he’s\n\nalso a poet and a scientist and was engaged in things like herbal medicine and working with\n\nlight and sound and frequency if any of you are familiar with the practices in the quadrivium\n\nGert was way into that kind of stuff uh in addition to writing one of the classics Faust that many of\n\nus uh would be familiar with in the whole Faustian bargain right when we’re playing with technology\n\nand so forth um the the cautionary tone of some of his wisdom is is really uh really imperative I\n\nthink in these times as well and I just thought um Artem uh helped help me uh get comfortable with the\n\nidea of maybe reading a poem or two just to share um a little creativity that’s happening here and\n\nso my son hunter um who by the way did an amazing uh video for climate change for his senior\n\nhigh school class as part of a c-span competition he participated in and we ended up sharing that\n\nthrough podcast episode number 67 so that’s my boy hunter chestnut parry and uh he and our collaborating\n\nputting together a book that is poetry I’ve written over the last uh 25 plus years with a bunch\n\nof his artwork and um uh I’m super excited about all this coming together we will be sharing it\n\npublicly uh in in the next month or two so keep an eye out and I I just thought I’d share a couple\n\nof the really short pieces as a way to I don’t know share a little poetry I know not everyone loves\n\npoetry but uh this one is half of a high coup and the invitation is to imagine the other half\n\non your own as you’re connecting with nature and it’s apropower out here in the woods right now\n\nbecause it goes like this missed droplet dangling from green leaf so I just invite you to\n\npicture that missed droplet dangling from green leaf whatever comes next is up to you\n\nand uh I I wrote that one you can believe it The year my daughter, OSHA, was born 1997.\n\nSo that goes back a little ways.\n\nAnd around that same time I wrote one that’s also quite short,\n\nnot as short as a haiku, but it’s called We Soon Recordess.\n\nAnd this morning I was like, gosh, I better look that word up\n\nand just make sure I know exactly what it means.\n\nAnd it turns out I remember it meaning sort of becoming alive or active again,\n\nbut it also means to break out and is used in the context of viruses sometimes.\n\nSo that’s kind of interesting.\n\nBut it doesn’t necessarily mean a viral outbreak.\n\nIt can have a very positive connotation as well.\n\nAnd so this one goes We Soon Recordess.\n\nLone Nouveau Humanity.\n\nSpringtime Sproutings from Dark Mustymold.\n\nBurnt all winter by fragility and harsh rains.\n\nGray Fogs Lift.\n\nFloat elsewhere.\n\nSlowly.\n\nAs we blink, no squint in rediscovered brilliance.\n\nSo that piece again came to me about 20 years ago\n\nand was really feeling the sense that our modern human story\n\nand experience on the planet in our lifetime is really inviting us to create\n\nand to live into something new and something different.\n\nAnd dare I say something better.\n\nAnd we have this opportunity together.\n\nAnd it’s very much that impulse that is behind all the work we’re doing\n\nwith the Wieners community and just want to take this opportunity\n\nto further invite each and every one of you to engage even more with what we’re up to.\n\nAnd if you want, you can find the global map of our ambassadors and projects\n\nand resources were connected to all around the world.\n\nThat’s also at Wieners.org.\n\nUnder the Resources section, you’ll see a link to Global Map.\n\nYou’ll also see the location of most of our podcast guests.\n\nThe last couple I need to update, I’ll admit that on camera.\n\nBut virtually all of them are there so you can see where people are located,\n\nincluding, for example, our friend Sophie Coscos and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd so join us in this work and take advantage of the products we have with Walei Waters.\n\nIf you go to the Wieners.org website under the Community section,\n\nyou’ll see there’s a page for the Walei Waters monthly program.\n\nYou can also go to WaleiWaters.com to download your own free soaking ceremony guide\n\nright as you were talking about candles and kind of your setup that made me think of that.\n\nAnd so what an amazing time, what a tremendously challenging time.\n\nAnd in all of this, I think there really is a whole lot of silver lining that we can connect with\n\nand that we can perceive with our vision back to the Vuka,\n\nand that we can deliberately cultivate in our day to day.\n\nThis coming week in particular is a real opportunity, I think, for all of us.\n\nYeah, I love that line.\n\nAnd the poem you just read of, Springtime Sprouting, it’s just such a vivid image of what that really looks like.\n\nAnd as I visualize what sprouting means, it first starts with deep rootedness.\n\nAnd so there’s the seed, and then as it really grows out and has those shoots that first go into the ground,\n\nand then there’s a shoot going up that we apply ourselves in that same way.\n\nAnd what’s truly inspiring to me about going through this time period is that we get to do that with other people.\n\nYou know, we might be socially distanced physically, but we can come together virtually.\n\nAnd we can help each other to grow those roots so that our communal shoot and the sprout that rises up above the ground can be strong and vibrant and produce fruit.\n\nAnd that fruit really is about a sustainable future.\n\nAnd it’s about continuing the dialogue, continuing the conversation of how do we continue to build and encourage our cities to have communal gardens.\n\nHow do we petition our HOAs to have food and not lawns?\n\nAnd how do we continue to pass legislation to ban some of the harmful pesticides that are out there in our home department stores\n\nthat building supply stores that really have no business in being on the shelves because of how powerful of a poison they are, they really compromise our immune systems among other things, right?\n\nYeah, and at the end of the day, it’s not just about the birds and the bees, and obviously birds and the bees are so important, but as we consider our own health in this time period,\n\nit is directly about taking care of ourselves by placing some of these limitations on on poisons and encouraging organic and above that biodynamic growth and gardening.\n\nAnd continuing the conversation with people who might not be aware of the differences or just how impactful some of these different approaches can be.\n\nIt’s something that really happens very slowly, and that’s something to really pay attention to, the fact that our situation overall is much more dire on this planet than just the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAnd part of the reason that we’re so reactive to it is because it’s so visceral for us, the changes between having three cases and thousands with thousands of deaths is a matter of a few weeks.\n\nWe as humans do pretty well with that timeline. We can see the effects of not taking action very directly, and so we can’t help but to take action.\n\nAnd as we take action in combating COVID-19 and really creating a resilient society out of this and encouraging healthy outcomes from the situation, let’s not forget, let’s really remember that there’s a much larger crisis at hand that plays out a lot slower.\n\nBut it’s so much more detrimental to our complete future and survival on this planet as species, and that the urgency is just as real if not more real than the virus itself.\n\nAnd that’s the climate and ecological crisis, specifically.\n\nYeah, I’m really, I’m, I’m hopeful, Artem, that so many of us are going to deepen to use your description of the roots, deepen our connection with Earth, with wisdom, with knowledge,\n\nand grow even more robustly together in community to tackle these big challenges that we’re facing.\n\nYeah, it’s going to take a lot of vision, it’s going to take a lot of agility, it’s going to take a lot of understanding, it’s going to take a lot of clarity,\n\nand may we really do what we can to cultivate that as individuals, as friends of our family and community.\n\nIt really is a big and beautiful opportunity for us.\n\nYeah, it is, and I’m honored to be a part of this network and to the listeners out there who are listening to this podcast,\n\nI encourage you to check out some of the resources that are available as part of the why and earth community, part of the why and earth ambassador network,\n\nand reach out to people directly in this network, and to the people who are directly leading the way in the narrative around all of these issues,\n\nand not only the issues, but the implementation of what we want more in our world, and there’s some really wonderful efforts underway,\n\nso the more that we can be in communication with people in those areas and create our own hubs in our own communities around these things.\n\nThis is the time to do that and take the opportunity of a bit of a home retreat, if you will, if that’s what you’re experiencing.\n\nTo think about who you would like to reach out, and how would you like to reach out to the people around you, and how do you want to support others,\n\nand how would you like to be supported by these efforts? This is an open conversation, so reach out, you know,\n\nDM, PM, email, text, you know, live stream, live broadcast, hashtag, like, do all the things, and then once you’re kind of good on that digital communication front, dig in and get your hands dirty.\n\nI love it, I mean, yeah, one of the things we’re in the process of implementing is a page on the website that shows all of our individual ambassadors,\n\nand what they’ve accomplished thus far, and the invitation to ambassadors is to create a short video, one to two minute video,\n\nsharing a little about each individual and what they’re up to in terms of projects and so forth.\n\nSo if that’s something that speaks to you, that’s just another kind of echo of that invitation to engage in that way as well.\n\nAnd I’m struck as you’re talking about the opportunity for food gardens in neighborhoods with HOAs and so forth, that one of the things we’ve been working on for a few months now is a handbook, a resource for neighborhoods and HOAs,\n\nspecifically around stewardship and sustainability. So excited for that one.\n\nYou know, it’s funny because over the last few days, I was just like, I’m going to use a cuss word, oh shit, like this is the worst time to bring something like that out.\n\nAnd then I was thinking about it, and as we’ve been talking over these last couple days, I’m realizing, wait a minute, this actually could be a very perfect time for something like that to come out because a big part of the threat running through all of that is,\n\nis increased resilience, health and well-being at that scale.\n\nAnd so it’s like, oh, okay, yeah, this probably will be in some ways and even more timely resource to be sharing with folks.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYeah, and resilience and putting food on the table, it goes beyond any kind of political divides or any of those things.\n\nSo, you know, it’s taking care of ourselves and living in communities that take care of one another, that communicate with the neighbors that are next door and in the larger community,\n\nmaking sure that the people are okay around us, that they’re taking care of, and that we have resilient communities that grow food together.\n\nAnd this is a wonderful time to engage HOAs in some of these other associations in that conversation because it’s very real for folks.\n\nYeah, really as art of, I’m reminded of, in Slovenia, most of the families in that beautiful little nation have pretty sizable gardens, it’s just part of the culture there.\n\nAnd it goes back a few hundred years in the history.\n\nAnd you would call these either really large gardens or really small farms basically.\n\nSo, they’ve got an incredible food resilience and sustainability woven into the social fabric and into the physical reality of that way of being.\n\nAnd there’s still a very much, a very technical, industrial economy, right?\n\nAnd so, we really can, this is a both-hand in terms of what opportunities lie directly in front of us and what doors are opening up to us as a culture, as a society in the midst of this crisis.\n\nAnd I wanted to just take a quick opportunity to thank our sponsors in our ecosystem for making all this work possible.\n\nAnd that includes many individuals and ambassadors who have joined our monthly giving program.\n\nA huge thanks to each of you.\n\nAnd you can join the monthly giving program on the Donate button at the top of the website, Winorff.org.\n\nAt any level, any level helps all of this work that we’re doing.\n\nAnd I want to also give a special shout out to the LIDGE Family Foundation, Brad and Lindsay have been incredibly supportive of all of this work for several years now, including during the time that the book itself, Y on Earth, was being written and editing and completed for publishing.\n\nAnd just a reminder that Y on Earth is available as an e-book and as an audiobook.\n\nSo that’s another resource you may enjoy checking out. And there’s a chapter called Grow where we talk about growing some of your own food.\n\nWe talk about getting some of your food from farmers you know in your region and then getting other food and beverage products from fair trade and certified organic purveyors that are bringing the teas and the coffees and the bananas and the avocados to us from different communities all around the world.\n\nAnd we’re so excited to be collaborating with the Rodeil Institute and that ecosystem of organizations, Patagonia, Dr. Bronners, Demeter and others who are launching the certified, the regenerative organic certification later this year as a way for all of us to rally around the entire spectrum of social and environmental practices when it comes to our food production, as well as our clothing fiber production.\n\nAnd so that’s just an exciting thing that’s underway. It’s happening and we get to rally behind that in a big way. And of course, want to give also a shout out to Purium who is providing a whole bunch of organic, phytonutrient based supplements and health and wellness products.\n\nAnd you can click on the Purium link from the sponsor page or the podcast page on the YonEarth website to get your products and some of the proceeds come back to support the YonEarth community.\n\nAnd of course, Earth Coast Productions, Artem’s company doing all of this amazing video live streaming technology and media work for a variety of companies and organizations. That’s earthcoast.com.\n\nAnd then Waylay Waters, as we’ve been mentioning and discussing, please check Waylay Waters out at WaylayWaters.com.\n\nAnd I think that I want to ask you, Artem, about how is this impacting your business, right? And what are we seeing? Because you do so much work with conferences and events.\n\nAnd we know in that community that there are some very real impacts that people are already experiencing. And, you know, I’m really interested in not only how those impacts are showing up, but also you’re very with a lot of agility, pivoting and responding and really like interesting creative and strategic ways right now and thought it might be a nice opportunity to ask you about that.\n\nYeah, thank you. And certainly happy to be working with YonEarth and supporting you and supporting all of the media needs there. And yeah, this time is definitely challenging for everyone who’s in some way an event business or is doing business with event businesses.\n\nAnd that includes, you know, conferences and musicians and concerts and venues, you know, weddings are having to be put on hold travel plans. Everybody’s very much impacted by all of this.\n\nAnd tourism globally is definitely taking a hit. And even restaurants, which you don’t typically think of as an event business, but it is an event to go out or being impacted in terms of a drop in reservation.\n\nAnd all of those things since people are staying at home. And I certainly work with a number of nonprofits and for profit businesses and various industries that had to cancel their events, had to cancel their conferences.\n\nAnd some of this is very meaningful work, very impactful work. There’s a number of nonprofits whose entire yearly budgets or a very significant majority of their yearly budget is directly dependent on a particular event and a live auction or fundraiser that happens at that event.\n\nAnd those are having to be put on hold or canceled, which totally impacts the bottom line for that organization nonprofit. And so my biggest message to everyone who is thinking about canceling their event is don’t cancel live stream live broadcast event.\n\nThere are ways to structure it. You can do a online live auction. You can hold certainly multi camera live broadcasting conferences, tele summits and teleconferences.\n\nAnd there are ways to make those experiences completely interactive with quizzes and forms and keep people’s engagement up and even have two way communication with video capabilities for both the presenters and the participants.\n\nAnd so if you have any questions, definitely reach out. I’m happy to help happy to consult I offer free consultations for folks who are interested in live streaming and live broadcasting.\n\nAnd there’s an incredible opportunity to augment some of the challenges that are coming about with the coronavirus and all of the cancellations with the online and online experiential interactive way of doing video.\n\nSo it’s something that I actually encourage all businesses to be considering moving forward in addition to their in-person portion of the event either way.\n\nAnd then, you know, unfortunately now the in-person part of the event can’t really happen. And so definitely aware of how much that means to folks who depend on events production and events to happen for people to get together for, you know, wonderful night out with music and dancing, which, you know, it’s certainly not the same dancing in your living room.\n\nBut you do get to enjoy the wonderful music of your favorite musicians.\n\nI dance much more freely in the living room. There you go.\n\nYeah, but the impact obviously are very immediate and are really, really significant in certain sectors of the economy right now.\n\nYeah, yeah. I’m aware and speaking to a few of my friends who are actually shutting down their businesses and having to let go of employees.\n\nAnd so we’re certainly just beginning to feel the repercussions of this time period. And so as we’re going through this time together, just be aware of those impacts.\n\nAnd, you know, reach out on that front as well of, you know, let’s brainstorm together on what’s possible.\n\nYou know, none of us really hold the answer, but I think as we come together and kind of openly discuss like here’s what’s happening, here’s the impact and what is possible.\n\nHow do we continue to engage? How do we continue to support each other with, you know, donations and other really important work that our business are doing that there’s wonderful ways that it can continue to happen, even if it’s a big pivot from business as usual.\n\nYep. Yeah, absolutely. It’s requiring adaptation, right? Adaptation. And who was it? Some great thinkers said something like adaptation is the mark of intelligence.\n\nI’ll try to dig that up for the show notes when we publish this. So I’ve seen that one before I’ve heard that statement. It’s to be able to adapt to these environments is how we’ve survived thus far as a species.\n\nWe all come up from a line of long line of people who have survived all kinds of cataclysm and disasters and various plagues and this is certainly in that larger scheme of things bump in the road.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t feel that way now. Certainly doesn’t feel that way for me. I’ve had a number of events canceled and just truly trying to help people continue to just stay engaged with their community.\n\nYeah. Yeah, I think there’s an interesting observation to make, which is simply by virtue of being alive right now as a human being necessarily indicates that we come from people who have survived calamity and catastrophe in the past.\n\nAnd so, you know, we’ve been through as a species been through a lot of different really challenging times and episodes and have thus far made it through.\n\nAnd I think hopefully we can draw a little bit of strengths from that knowing and that DNA knowing lives in us and to keep hold that precious each day as we’re going forward right now.\n\nSo, I think I have only one other item on my list that I wanted to share, Artem, for this particular episode.\n\nAnd then I wanted to do just kind of a recap summary for everyone about the various things we hit on.\n\nSo, I don’t know if is there anything else that you want to mention as well that is maybe on the list here or that we had discussed over the last couple of days.\n\nI think just continuing with creativity, just really the importance of asking yourself what you want to bring in the world and perhaps you already know that and just working on those projects.\n\nAnd I know you’ve got something cooking that you might want to have.\n\nThat’s like a perfect segue to share on. You set that up. I guess you did.\n\nYeah, so I’m sharing this I think for two reasons, maybe three. One is that it really I think highlights the importance of storytelling in all of the work that we’re doing to help transform and to help heal.\n\nSecondly, I think I want to share this because up till now it’s only been a very small number of friends and family who know about this particular project.\n\nAnd there’s a certain power in telling more people that this thing is quite substantial at this point and we’ll be sharing shared with the world soon.\n\nAnd so I’ve been working on a novel and a screenplay for a little while now and by a little while I mean a couple years.\n\nAnd what I’m holding here is the first section out of three. It’s a three act story, which just about a week ago I completed a full edit run through.\n\nAnd the other two sections are quite far along. There’s a lot more to do, but this is one of the things that I’ll be working on in the coming weeks hours and hours of work goes into book writing.\n\nIt’s it’s remarkable. I’ve managed organizations. I’ve done a lot of different types of work over the years, graduate school, et cetera.\n\nAnd writing books for me is one of the most challenging things I’ve ever endeavored to accomplish in terms of the discipline that’s required.\n\nBecause right, like in business, we respond to all kinds of external stimuli, right?\n\nCustomer needs show up, market dynamic shift, whatever it might be.\n\nBut when it’s something like writing a book, essentially there is nothing but this internally generated willful desire to move the project forward.\n\nAnd there are plenty of days, especially when editing something thick like this and it takes hours, where you feel like you’re making no progress at all.\n\nBut it’s that stick to itness, that determination, that grit that comes into play in so many different aspects of our lives that is what determines whether you end up with something like a book or not.\n\nAnd I know a lot of us have ideas for books and some of us write books.\n\nAnd that takes an extraordinary amount of patience and willfulness. And I guess I share this as a way to encourage you all if you have a poem, if you have a painting, a drawing, if you have some crochet, some sewing, something you want to do, do it, do it.\n\nJust sit down and start to do it. And what will flow from that choice to do it, I think is incredibly magical, incredibly vitalizing.\n\nAnd often we get surprised in these utterly delightful ways by the mystery of what unfolds when we’re willing to engage with that creativity in that way.\n\nSo this is a story called Otto coming soon and stay tuned for that. And yeah, just to recap, health, well-being, take care of yourself, soak, yoga, herbal medicine, check out the podcast with Brigitte Mars, number 19.\n\nCheck out the podcast, Artem and I did a year ago, number 31. The podcast with Dr. Gendel Allen Davis, episode 30. Definitely want to mention the podcast with Eric Lombardi, which was episode 65 in which we talk about social enterprise.\n\nThese are for-profit businesses that are devoting at least half of their profits to social and environmental non-profit organizations and causes.\n\nAnd Waylay Waters is an example of that. Soil works, which were in the process of launching is an example of that. And we’ve got a couple others that are in development right now that you’ll be hearing about in the coming months. So stay tuned for that.\n\nAnd don’t forget, if you want to join the Waylay Waters monthly program through Y on Earth, you can go to yhonourth.org under the community section, scroll to the Waylay page.\n\nAnd you’ll see that you can sign up at the $33, the $88 or the $133 level, your choice.\n\nAnd the first 10 folks to do that will get a free tin of the hemp CBD SAV that we’re in the process of launching. So really excited to share that with you all.\n\nAnd just remember, we’re all in this together. And we have so much to be grateful for, health, well-being, friendship.\n\nAnd I think, Adam, when we first talked about doing this episode together a few weeks ago, we were thinking a lot about the neuro biochemistry and stress and co-regulation in relationships, especially when we have a professional relationship that is also a friendship, like you and I have."
