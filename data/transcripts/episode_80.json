  "full_transcript": "[8.4s - 16.5s]: Hey friends, this next podcast episode is with Adrian Alex Rodriguez and we recorded this\n\n[16.5s - 22.2s]: last fall when he and I revolved at a Earth X gathering down in Dallas, Texas.\n\n[23.0s - 28.5s]: So hope you enjoy and just want to share with you the pre-COVID context of our discussion.\n\n[28.5s - 35.5s]: Enjoy! Welcome to the Y on Earth communities, stewardship and sustainability podcast series.\n\n[36.3s - 41.3s]: And today we are visiting with Adrian Alex Rodriguez. Hi Adrian Alex.\n\n[41.5s - 49.3s]: Hi. Good to see you. Good to see you. Yes. So Adrian Alex lives in Mexico City and was\n\n[49.3s - 56.6s]: born on the coast of the Sea of Cortez. He is the founder of Bodai which I am really excited\n\n[56.6s - 64.6s]: for you all to learn about which has been called the first environmental platform using social media as an active tool.\n\n[65.7s - 75.0s]: Bodai covers nine topical and content sections which we will be talking about and Adrian Alex also has expertise\n\n[75.0s - 82.0s]: in sustainable projects that are triple bottom line focused on the balance and harmony between economic,\n\n[82.0s - 91.1s]: natural and social aspects. He works in communication strategies for artists and curates impact strategies for nature.\n\n[92.4s - 99.7s]: Adrian Alex is a youth activist and participated in the first global climate strike in Guadalajara, Mexico,\n\n[100.4s - 111.0s]: the second in Mexico City and the third in New York City in September of 2019 which of course I was there\n\n[111.0s - 117.6s]: for that as well. So we are several of our Y on Earth community ambassadors and board members including\n\n[117.6s - 121.9s]: Joni Clarke and give a shout out off camera. Hey Joni. Hi.\n\n[122.4s - 133.3s]: And of course this is the march where Greta Tunberg and Shia Bastita were among many of the global youth leaders and indigenous leaders.\n\n[134.3s - 141.6s]: And Adrian Alex also produces the mushroom festival of Guadalajara which I am excited to talk about that as well.\n\n[141.9s - 151.2s]: So it is so great. We are here in Dallas, Texas. We connected at EarthX and I am really thrilled to have this opportunity to visit with you\n\n[151.2s - 154.3s]: and to share with our audience the amazing work that you are doing.\n\n[154.3s - 164.8s]: Yeah. I am happy to say hi to everyone and give a little taste about which kind of projects in Mexico we have around sustainability and nature.\n\n[165.2s - 170.7s]: Wonderful. So let's talk about Boda right? This is amazing. What's happening?\n\n[170.7s - 189.2s]: Yeah well like five years ago I was just dedicating to communication strategies around artists and like products and I sense the need of using this tool but will actual empowering something real like nature.\n\n[189.2s - 206.3s]: So we started having a lot of names in our mind and I was with this girl that was one of the founders with me and we started detecting the need of making a real name.\n\n[206.3s - 222.6s]: So Boda came from the Sanskrit that is one of the oldest languages in the world and means like the awakening of conscious, like becoming more conscious about what surrounds you and at knowledge the power of nature.\n\n[223.5s - 236.0s]: Absolutely beautiful. And you've described for me a little bit in terms of what you're doing with Boda and the primary platform right is on Instagram. Is that right?\n\n[236.5s - 252.0s]: Yeah well we have seen that most people use Instagram as not cool tool so we want to show people that young people and like every kind of age people also are interest.\n\n[263.8s - 282.0s]: So what kind of images are people seeing on Boda? Well we try to be cool so we try to do a lot of serve image as a serve. Yeah we have a section around serve but because what's so difficult to maintain content of service.\n\n[282.0s - 300.4s]: We have to change it to plants animals but what's really cool and also we have noticed people have a really good reaction to museum pictures because they're like magical and like have these colors or these like different structures.\n\n[300.4s - 323.8s]: And also we try to have information that actually acts and like make solutions and involve people and notice them what they can do to change role like we we're not only about talking about the problems we also talk about the solutions like that's so important and you have quite a following right?\n\n[323.8s - 340.8s]: Yeah well we're getting almost 50,000 followers to Instagram and we'll all the network we we control in Mexico with different NGOs because we're on the Instagram of those NGOs like Earthics Mexico like the echo symbol.\n\n[340.8s - 348.8s]: So our network is getting to 100,000 followers between all the networks. Oh my gosh that's really amazing.\n\n[348.8s - 363.3s]: And how long have you been at that with those different NGOs? Well like I said I started with artists and with products like six years ago and like full time to the environment like since far years ago.\n\n[363.5s - 376.2s]: Cool. I love it. So with these these nine different topical areas and themes we walk us through what are they and what would we experience when we check that out?\n\n[376.2s - 405.1s]: Yeah. What what we do is we get together these academic people like biologies engineers and also that just people that really love nature like young people to have a specific teams like nutrition like serve like plants and each week we upload an article of each section and trying to motivate people to live in a healthy way or to live\n\n[405.1s - 425.6s]: or understand more plants because sometimes for example you go to a pharmacy to buy something that you have the plant over there that that cures that need and it's more sustainable because you don't have to get to the record to go to the pharmacy to have like this plastic delivery to you.\n\n[425.6s - 442.1s]: Yeah. So I believe that everything we need is in nature. So both I mean that understanding nature like giving knowledge and accepting knowledge from different people like absolutely.\n\n[442.3s - 453.7s]: And from nature absolutely. This is beautiful. I know it'll make one of our global advisory board members very happy Brigitte Mars who is an herbalist who teaches all around the world.\n\n[453.7s - 472.7s]: She has a course she does every year in Colombia for example and has written 17 books about herbal medicine and she often is telling us look there's often medicine right outside the window maybe in the yard or just down the street a little ways and you don't have to go buy expensive pharmaceuticals for a lot of the things we're treating right.\n\n[472.7s - 487.8s]: Well, we will be great to have one of those well information of to have an article in our blog of that would be fabulous. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we can definitely. Maybe I'll just favor 10 maybe I don't know. I know her I know her three favorite.\n\n[487.8s - 502.5s]: We talked about this is a good idea actually. That would be cool. So so what are the nine themes that you guys focus on? Well, first like we start with something easy like news like informing people.\n\n[502.9s - 509.1s]: Then we have one of our audience favorite that is Fungi. And yeah, Fungi.\n\n[509.1s - 522.5s]: Mushrooms and fungus. If you're not familiar with Fungi. Yeah, it's a section when she will I use around mushrooms and because the pictures and our biology is that provides this information.\n\n[522.8s - 535.3s]: She's so brilliant that we have a cool area over there like I'm starting doing projects also around that section. Cool. And we have also nutrition. Yeah.\n\n[535.3s - 553.9s]: Healthy lifestyle. Like I said, animal plants. Yeah, recommendations. Yeah, initiatives and expression that is like how nature and human beings are connected are texted like like we are really connected just be young.\n\n[553.9s - 578.8s]: I love it. Yeah, and you know the the the fungite connection it reminds me in Colorado where I'm from. We have the Colorado Micological Society online. And there's a lot of people on there. And we help each other identify different species. It's it's really it's wonderful. And when we get big flushes after the rains and the autumn.\n\n[578.8s - 593.0s]: A lot of people go out foraging for different species. It's a lot of fun to see that kind of unfold in the community across you know a pretty big region. Yeah, and I believe so that in the mushroom like in the Fungi kingdom.\n\n[593.9s - 612.1s]: We're we're having done that much experiments because biology said there's over three million of species in the world. And we just have identified a 10% 300,000. And of those 25,000 are in Mexico. Oh, yeah, wow.\n\n[612.1s - 640.1s]: Yeah, Mexico is one of the richest countries in diversity in mushrooms. Well, you know everything. Yeah, I've heard it's ranked up really high worldwide. Is that right? Yeah, it's like Mexico with the Mesoamerican Rift is the fourth biggest biodiversity in the world. And it is one of the 12 countries that represent the 70% of all the nature in the world. Oh, my goodness.\n\n[640.8s - 661.0s]: I'm just writing a couple quick notes here. I'll try to keep up with this. This is really interesting and important. You know, I I remember learning about one of my early heroes and all of this is Paul Stammett's. And I remember hearing him talk about how he came to realize that on the Pacific coast of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n[661.0s - 688.6s]: There was so much biodiversity. It was essential to protect. Of course, there's a lot of logging that occurs in that part of the world. And I understand if I if the story's true that he actually went into the Pentagon of the United States talked to the very high leaders in the military and said, look, when we're dealing with things like bioterism and other biological issues, we really need to preserve these resources because they may end up saving a lot of lives in the future.\n\n[688.6s - 699.6s]: And apparently that helped preserve an enormous tract of old growth forest basically along the Pacific Northwest coast. Yeah, it was amazing.\n\n[699.7s - 713.8s]: When that area with the Sea of Cortez, they call it the Aquarium of the World. Yeah. And also in that area, we have the shark island that is the biggest island in Mexico is not populated.\n\n[713.8s - 735.5s]: Island because it's about the ingenious community are the owners, not the government of Mexico. They're called cities. It's the ancient community and they've been really good protecting that area and trying to do a good economic system without harming nature.\n\n[735.5s - 756.4s]: Oh, interesting. Okay, this is we'll get the spelling on saddies and maybe it'd be cool to provide a link in the show notes to something about what is the island called shark island shark. Okay, got it in Spanish is like the one on okay. Okay, cool. I'm not sure my spelling is very good in Spanish. So I have to circle back.\n\n[756.4s - 774.5s]: Yeah, so hey, I just want to get these these stats down. So we were saying we think there are maybe three million species of fungus worldwide. We buy D 300,000 worldwide and we know 25,000 are in Mexico. Is that right? Okay, that's amazing. Yeah.\n\n[776.1s - 787.9s]: And let's talk a little bit about the mushroom festival in Guadalajara that you produce. What is this? What is it? What does it look like? I want to go right?\n\n[788.1s - 797.3s]: Yeah, well, it's at the end of the mushroom season that is brain season like around the end of July or August.\n\n[797.3s - 817.0s]: And why Guadalajara because Calisco, it has a really rich diversity around mushrooms. And I have a community will community was doing this event in both I gets to the event two years ago and start producing it with them.\n\n[817.0s - 839.8s]: And like giving much more value because now we have a biology is that identify each mushrooms like to everyone that surrounds like so the first activity is going to the camp and like trying to have the most diversity of mushrooms to get these mushrooms to the festival.\n\n[839.8s - 869.8s]: Where is like music and a lot of exhibitors that have a product or products of mushrooms like Gun of their my tracks like they sell like mushrooms in bags and beers that are with mushrooms and all kind of products even generally like so energetically is a found festival that try to make people understand that mushrooms are much that is a lot of fun.\n\n[869.8s - 895.9s]: And only like the magical mushroom like we have much culinary diversity of mushrooms. We also have pharmaceutical and medicinal mushrooms and we have also to understand what mushroom means in nature because are the ones that are in charge to connect everything they say mushrooms are the internet of the world.\n\n[895.9s - 914.2s]: I love that. Yeah, and I've heard as we begin to really understand what's going on with the myciliol mats, the networks in the soil and the complexity of connections among and between varieties of species varieties of kingdoms right.\n\n[915.2s - 943.1s]: This absolutely dwarfs all of our technology. And we were talking about this last night. I think it's one of the most important points for us to understand in these times given what's at stake with the environmental situation, the climate situation, what's living in the soil is so essential to not only understand but to celebrate to protect to be grateful for and to work with to help heal a lot of the challenges that we're facing right.\n\n[943.1s - 966.2s]: Yeah, well, I'm not an expert like in soil, but for me like they teach me that with the most powerful technology and with the most well economic power also, you cannot make a system to bring like certain kind of mushrooms because they're complexity.\n\n[966.2s - 980.4s]: So nature is the only one that has that power. So we humans is like is a lesson we need to understand that we cannot play the role of making everything with technology.\n\n[980.7s - 990.1s]: There's certain things in nature that speak by themselves with bodhaya and I have a diet speak with them.\n\n[990.1s - 1004.8s]: I absolutely love it. It's one in the why on earth community we talk a lot about humility and for us to really have that kind of humility to understand just how awesome how powerful how essential these natural systems are.\n\n[1005.0s - 1015.0s]: Yeah, right. Beautiful. Oh my goodness. So by the way, I was going to ask with the mushroom diversity in Halisco.\n\n[1015.0s - 1032.2s]: This is also where the ritual people live. No, that's always put to see, but it's near that in Mexico, the most diversity came from Beracruz and Oaxaca that are like southern states, not down south, but southern because it's really tropical.\n\n[1032.2s - 1046.4s]: Like the mushrooms like a lot of humidity and like so that that's a really and also there's a big diversity because they're high places and all places. So that also you graphically it's important.\n\n[1046.4s - 1075.0s]: What I would love to have them are in Mexico people to involve is like when we were in mushroom collection in Switzerland, they have a lot of how I can tell you they have a lot of strategies to teach people how to identify mushrooms and they have identification centers that are open in certain.\n\n[1076.0s - 1089.6s]: In hours and in certain season in the year that you go with your mushrooms, you can collect only one kilogram and they identified it to you and you can take it home and you can cook them.\n\n[1090.1s - 1098.0s]: So it will be really cool to start having these identification centers in all the world love this and will be cool to start in Mexico and Dallas.\n\n[1099.9s - 1101.0s]: Maybe both.\n\n[1101.3s - 1106.4s]: So did you happen to did you harvest any champagne in Switzerland? Did you have this kind?\n\n[1106.8s - 1114.2s]: No, we have like it was calling Mexico. We said a panesito that is boletos.\n\n[1114.6s - 1118.9s]: Oh yeah, boletos. We have a lot of this in Colorado, King, Belito.\n\n[1118.9s - 1132.6s]: Yeah, well, it's not that easy to find. And in Mexico, we have a big diversity. There's Asian shaman called Maria Savina from Wajaca in Mexico.\n\n[1133.3s - 1139.4s]: It's one of the most recognized places in the world for mushrooms, Wautla de Humanas.\n\n[1139.4s - 1142.8s]: And it's because they have like this.\n\n[1144.1s - 1165.0s]: Mushroom that have these psycho effects and she was a shaman that without the biologist knowledge that we the nature and the Asian knowledge like she understand them and she was the guide of the Beatles when they go to Mexico.\n\n[1165.0s - 1169.2s]: And that sounds so while these they went with the Beatles the band.\n\n[1169.3s - 1173.2s]: The band. While these they was with her also.\n\n[1173.8s - 1175.6s]: And all those hooksley.\n\n[1176.4s - 1185.4s]: Yeah, he I really appreciate all this hooksley as a writer of course. He's written a couple of really amazing and important books I think.\n\n[1185.4s - 1194.5s]: Yeah, in fact, one is called Island. Did you ever read this book Island? It's not as well known as some of his others, but it's a fabulous read.\n\n[1195.0s - 1198.5s]: And mushrooms actually figure in the story pretty prominently.\n\n[1199.3s - 1206.0s]: So maybe if any of you are looking for a good one to read soon, check out Island by all this hooksley.\n\n[1206.8s - 1212.1s]: This is amazing. I'm just jotting down the Beatles while Disney, all this hooksley.\n\n[1212.1s - 1217.1s]: Yeah, well, she was like the queen of the mushrooms in Mexico.\n\n[1217.6s - 1226.6s]: Actually, we want to have a project because she is great. It's near the town.\n\n[1227.4s - 1233.6s]: And we want to restrict all the the great because now it's like in ruins.\n\n[1233.6s - 1237.3s]: Oh, we Mexicans and the Bullseye team.\n\n[1238.1s - 1242.7s]: Things that she deserves to have this like excellent grape.\n\n[1242.9s - 1247.1s]: It's like a really spiritual and iconic symbol for Mexicans.\n\n[1247.4s - 1253.2s]: So I will send you the picture when we do that. That's great. That's beautiful. Thank you for sharing that.\n\n[1253.2s - 1263.3s]: Well, and it's interesting how something like a grave marker, that kind of a monument can speak so much and can symbolize so much.\n\n[1263.9s - 1269.6s]: And you were telling me earlier about some art projects in New York City to switch gears a little bit.\n\n[1270.5s - 1274.9s]: That are really helping people develop awareness about what's going on in the world, right?\n\n[1274.9s - 1290.0s]: Yeah, well, in the climate strike, I met an artist is one of the most recognized artists environmental Irish because she used only plastic materials and recycled materials.\n\n[1290.1s - 1300.8s]: It's all about that to her. And so then she took me to a museum. It's called Arcadia Earth is in Broadway Street in New York.\n\n[1300.8s - 1313.0s]: This museum tries to do with innovation technologies and like with this artistic interventions try to sense of the lives people in environmental matters.\n\n[1313.8s - 1321.8s]: So this was a cave, a coral cave that its message was that the coral is bleaching.\n\n[1321.8s - 1341.9s]: So the cave is like why like it? And what's made with 44,000 plastic bags reuse salvage reuse plastic bags that represent a time where New Yorkers used these like ways these plastic bags.\n\n[1341.9s - 1349.1s]: And well, you mean your expectations about the time which time how much time it takes for 44,000?\n\n[1349.1s - 1351.0s]: Yeah, I mean what like an hour.\n\n[1351.2s - 1356.9s]: So one minute one minute. Oh my god. Wow, that's staggering.\n\n[1357.2s - 1360.2s]: Yeah, wow. 44,000 plastic bags.\n\n[1360.2s - 1366.9s]: It's really cool that if I tell you like you feel it, but when you see it like it.\n\n[1367.1s - 1377.9s]: So it's really cool artists are trying to get involved in this movement and given their Holland to have these kind of conversations and sense of the lives.\n\n[1378.7s - 1383.8s]: She's called Baycia and is she called these that habisualization.\n\n[1386.1s - 1391.9s]: Wow, I want to check that out. I'll actually be in New York soon after this recording.\n\n[1392.6s - 1396.7s]: So I'll have to keep an eye out and make a visit for that. It's still there.\n\n[1397.0s - 1399.7s]: Yeah, it's still there. It's about six months installation.\n\n[1399.8s - 1403.3s]: Okay, cool. And like I believe it has one month since they all went.\n\n[1403.5s - 1406.8s]: Oh, perfect. Okay. Yeah, around the time of the climate strike.\n\n[1406.8s - 1420.2s]: Yeah, yeah. Well, it was one of the places where a lot of climate strike movement was like that place everyone was going and having some interventions.\n\n[1420.8s - 1424.8s]: And actually, Erdix do an event over there.\n\n[1424.9s - 1434.8s]: Okay, cool. Yeah. So let me just remind our audience that this is the Why on Earth communities stewardship and sustainability podcast series.\n\n[1434.8s - 1443.2s]: And we are visiting with Adrian Alex Rodriguez from Mexico City, but we're in Dallas, Texas while we're recording this conversation.\n\n[1444.0s - 1456.8s]: And Adrian Alex has Bodai. You can find Bodai on Instagram with Bodai BODAI underscore or go RG will have this in the show notes.\n\n[1456.8s - 1466.7s]: Also online on the website is bowdai.org BODAI.org. And we're going to talk about eco symbol a little bit.\n\n[1466.9s - 1472.9s]: So if you're interested, you'll go to eco-symbol.com or at eco underscore symbol.\n\n[1473.6s - 1480.8s]: And I want to take a moment to give a huge thanks and shout out to our partners and sponsors who are making the series possible.\n\n[1480.8s - 1493.7s]: Who are making our digital resources a reality for folks and who are supporting our ongoing community mobilization work in real neighborhoods and real communities all over.\n\n[1494.4s - 1507.7s]: And this includes Patagonia, Weylay Waters, Purium, the Lidge Family Foundation, Beauty Counter, the International Society of Sustainability Professionals.\n\n[1507.7s - 1519.4s]: That's a mouthful. And the BioDynamic Association. Also a huge shout out to all the individuals out there who have joined our monthly giving program.\n\n[1520.2s - 1527.5s]: And this helps us with all the work that we're doing. It's a really big way of supporting this.\n\n[1527.5s - 1538.5s]: If you haven't yet joined the monthly giving program and you would like to, you can go to whyoners.org slash support or just go to the homepage whyoners.org hit the donate button.\n\n[1539.1s - 1544.2s]: And you can sign up for any level that works well for you to give on a monthly basis.\n\n[1544.5s - 1553.5s]: When you do that, I'll send you an email with an exclusive very special code to unlock all of our ebook and audio book resources for free.\n\n[1553.5s - 1560.6s]: And you can share that with friends and family as well as if you'd like to. So a huge thanks to everybody for your support.\n\n[1561.4s - 1570.9s]: And I am just thrilled Adrian Alex about this opportunity to chat with you. Here it is. It's about fall autumn here in 2019.\n\n[1571.7s - 1578.2s]: And a lot of us are really starting to plan and prepare for 2020. Because there's a whole lot that's going to be happening, right?\n\n[1578.2s - 1587.2s]: Yeah. And I'm just curious, what are you seeing and envisioning when you're thinking about 2020 and what's come in and what are some of the priorities you're working on?\n\n[1587.5s - 1607.2s]: Okay. Well, what I felt is like this you we start sensing these energetic feeling around environmental activities and around involving Jude with these politicians and with these big entrepreneurs.\n\n[1607.2s - 1617.6s]: So we can actually have some plans from now to five years to contribute to our planet.\n\n[1618.2s - 1632.5s]: And for us, but I we're starting a project like I tell you that it's called for biodiversity that it's like the project will be trying to protect this biodiversity that is from the sea of Cortez,\n\n[1632.5s - 1642.3s]: North of Mexico to the American, Mesoamerican reef that actually represent almost the 15% of biodiversity in the world.\n\n[1643.3s - 1661.0s]: So we're trying to do a big crowdfunding scheme around communication strategies, one of our expertise and also trying to use the vehicle and the relationships that Earth X as this big, the biggest environmental experience in the world.\n\n[1663.4s - 1676.6s]: So we're trying to start making more actions in 2020, actually going down the field and protecting our oceans and protecting our nature and empower what we have.\n\n[1676.6s - 1689.8s]: Because I love plastic and energy programs, but I believe we have to give more attention to protected areas and to keep what we actually have right now.\n\n[1690.1s - 1690.7s]: That's beautiful.\n\n[1691.2s - 1706.2s]: I love this. You know, in the first chapter of the book I wrote called Why On Earth, the very first chapter is called Place and how important that direct connection is to places where we live, where we spend time and for us to care as an stewardship of these places, right?\n\n[1706.2s - 1708.0s]: Yeah, that's what I hear you describing.\n\n[1708.3s - 1720.3s]: Yeah, and also because now we're sensing we have like more than 2000 species, endangered species and instantions in Mexico.\n\n[1720.3s - 1732.3s]: So if we start having these sense, we can have a lot of animals become instant and a lot of plants.\n\n[1732.9s - 1736.6s]: We don't want to start having that cycle.\n\n[1737.0s - 1746.5s]: Yeah, we have to have the cycle we have to protect and have more species because the species nature is so wonderful that you have to let it go.\n\n[1746.5s - 1752.0s]: Like if you let it go, it could do it by its own. It's amazing.\n\n[1752.8s - 1757.4s]: So also in 2020 we're having a couple events in Earth eggs in Mexico.\n\n[1757.9s - 1763.3s]: We have a couple in the north and one in the center of Mexico.\n\n[1763.3s - 1772.8s]: And one specific, the one of the Pacific coast, the team will be rescuing the Pacific coast.\n\n[1773.0s - 1784.0s]: No, that will be actual the name of the event rescuing the Pacific and we will be involved involving big organizations like\n\n[1784.0s - 1797.0s]: Bodaí, like Earth eggs, like Fridays for Future and like Fond and National Conservatory of Mexico and of species.\n\n[1797.8s - 1803.5s]: So we're trying to get in different aspects to get people involved.\n\n[1804.2s - 1809.9s]: Like the Mushroom Festival, these ocean protection events.\n\n[1809.9s - 1820.2s]: And also we will keep striking like every time like these young legaters ask us to strike.\n\n[1820.5s - 1827.9s]: We believe in its like recent and in its idealism.\n\n[1828.3s - 1837.4s]: And we will be together because that is what I've been felt feeling about environmental that we need to be more together.\n\n[1837.4s - 1845.9s]: We have to be unifying as a community because if we want to change everything we have to change us between.\n\n[1846.3s - 1852.6s]: How we express between us and how we can learn everyone from each other.\n\n[1853.2s - 1855.2s]: Absolutely. Love it. So beautiful.\n\n[1856.0s - 1863.5s]: Do you happen to know we recently did an interview with Emily Maglone, the New York director of Peaceboat.\n\n[1863.5s - 1871.5s]: Okay. And next summer 2020 they're going to be in the port in I think part of Ayarta or somewhere on the Pacific coast.\n\n[1871.8s - 1873.5s]: Do you have you connected with them about this?\n\n[1873.6s - 1881.9s]: Well, I'm not connected with them but I've connected with a project called Restore Coral that is really connected with them.\n\n[1881.9s - 1891.0s]: This project is trying to do like an arc or like a museum but we call it idealistic and no-ways arc.\n\n[1891.3s - 1896.0s]: To save the endemic species of coral in Mexico.\n\n[1896.8s - 1908.0s]: So if we're losing all these because of bleaching when we have the conditions of the ocean will be again the right ones.\n\n[1908.0s - 1913.1s]: So coral tend with shore. We have all these species in like in a bank.\n\n[1913.8s - 1919.8s]: So it's like a museum bank so people can understand in which moment we are.\n\n[1920.0s - 1922.5s]: Like we are actually are in that moment.\n\n[1922.9s - 1928.8s]: We need to pull species from the ecosystem because it's so in danger.\n\n[1928.8s - 1941.2s]: So we can keep them alive and then will hopefully the ocean with our help and with its help restructure.\n\n[1941.5s - 1949.8s]: So we can introduce this species. It's called Restore Coral and it's really connected with the Peaceboat.\n\n[1950.5s - 1952.7s]: That's good to hear. Yeah, I'm really happy.\n\n[1952.7s - 1961.6s]: As you're talking I'm realizing I think the term coral bleaching doesn't really do a good job of describing what this is.\n\n[1961.7s - 1966.1s]: And I want to make sure our audience some of us may not have heard about this before.\n\n[1966.7s - 1972.0s]: This is the massive die off of coral forests in the ocean basically.\n\n[1972.5s - 1980.6s]: This is a tremendous problem that we're seeing in ocean waters all around the world.\n\n[1980.6s - 1994.8s]: Yeah, well they call it the white syndrome because the coral start dying and will losing these properties that makes it alive because temperature issues and contamination issues pollution.\n\n[1995.1s - 2002.1s]: And so it's getting wide. Why losing its color until like what becomes that?\n\n[2002.1s - 2013.7s]: I don't have the sack numbers but they say that in South Mexico and the Caribbean in the last year we have lost more than 2% of all our coral.\n\n[2013.9s - 2017.6s]: 30% to represent. And that's the second largest coral reef in the world.\n\n[2018.0s - 2019.2s]: Yeah, I've thought you were strong in life.\n\n[2019.2s - 2022.8s]: Yeah, Ion or the US American coral reef.\n\n[2023.1s - 2033.0s]: Wow, okay. It's so important that we're all mobilizing and doing everything we can around these issues restoring healing, regenerating.\n\n[2033.3s - 2040.0s]: Yeah, well it's important for us like having this conversation each every day and everywhere.\n\n[2040.0s - 2052.4s]: Like if you feel like sometimes misunderstood because you talk about nature and you start having these sense of activism, you need to realize that you're not alone.\n\n[2052.6s - 2062.0s]: Like we're a lot of people that were compromising of changing stuff and it's good to give each other a pom in the back.\n\n[2063.3s - 2064.0s]: Absolutely.\n\n[2064.0s - 2089.8s]: That's such an important message. And you know, one of the really cool benefits I've actually talked about this with a few people in just in the last couple of days about doing these podcasts is that I get to meet and really learn about the work that amazing people are doing kind of all over the place in all sorts of sectors related to our future, related to taking care of the planet, related to being good to each other.\n\n[2089.8s - 2101.0s]: And it gives me great hope knowing that more and more of us are truly mobilizing and kind of making this big pivot that we're needing to make as a species and it's happening.\n\n[2101.7s - 2114.1s]: And it just makes me feel full of joy, notwithstanding how challenging things are right now that more and more of us are arising and responding to this very impulse that's happening.\n\n[2114.1s - 2129.6s]: Yeah, well, it is start like impulse. Now it's sensing like action, like it's started becoming action and our biology is true and like our academic crew.\n\n[2131.2s - 2147.8s]: Because they make people it's so smart and they they understand it's all about knowledge. We have to go for more knowledge like because most people talk about changing stuff, but if we don't understand nature, we cannot change it.\n\n[2147.8s - 2161.0s]: Actually, one of our projects for 2020 that usually like engineering, we want to do a showroom like in Mexico City that we have our own cultivate mushroom.\n\n[2161.6s - 2176.9s]: So people understand how they grow and its diversity and well, it's difficult to have a diversity in one showroom because they need different temperatures and different resources.\n\n[2176.9s - 2188.4s]: Where they grow, but we're trying to do something special for people. Maybe when you're next year in Mexico, we can show you around.\n\n[2188.4s - 2197.0s]: Oh, I can't wait. That'll be wonderful. Yeah, because right different species of mushroom are growing on different substrates, right? Different types of wood, other decomposing material.\n\n[2197.0s - 2227.0s]: Yeah, it could be books like I was talking to a couple of biologies for the podcast. They say even in a diaper, in a baby diaper, it depends on mushrooms like that. Right now what I'm understanding because well, I'm not the expert, but I'm understanding that much different resources is that like the diversity of mushrooms, but the fans here are the ones that actually want to be there.\n\n[2227.0s - 2239.5s]: The finding is good, for example, like the ones that have more properties, medicinal properties are really well more difficult to cultivate.\n\n[2240.9s - 2249.5s]: So this is really cool. If we try to understand nature, nature spokes to us, that's really.\n\n[2250.9s - 2265.5s]: So we're happy of that project and also we're really happy about the eco symbol project. The simple project is a project that we sense as a community, different activism.\n\n[2265.5s - 2286.1s]: These artists from New York, a couple of people in Mexico and different NGOs, we sense that between each NGO sometimes between academics, we have this sense of competition, of being competitive and having a certain kind of ego.\n\n[2286.1s - 2304.7s]: And then we realize how the LGBT movement grew up and like, consolidate like a real movement is because they really cool and they're really together and they really try to embrace everyone doesn't matter.\n\n[2304.7s - 2322.5s]: And I sense that the environmental movement needs this. So we were talking all these activists and we came down with idea called the eco symbol that is a flag is a symbol that represent us beyond anything.\n\n[2322.5s - 2333.7s]: No matter your NGO, your country, your age doesn't matter anything, but it's a symbol that represents hope to nature.\n\n[2334.8s - 2349.0s]: And it's a symbol that probably all the hotels, all the restaurants, all the people and enterprises that have this intention of becoming more environmental should adapt but we compromise.\n\n[2349.0s - 2356.4s]: Not with lies, no, if we want to adopt this symbol, we have to adapt it with real compromise.\n\n[2356.8s - 2358.9s]: Yeah, real value, real principles.\n\n[2359.0s - 2365.1s]: The real actions, like now action, like I was doing this, but now I'm doing this because I believe so.\n\n[2365.1s - 2376.7s]: Yeah, excellent. Oh, that's really exciting to hear about. So that's eco symbol and in folks, like as we mentioned, you can go to eco-symbol.com or it's at eco underscore symbol.\n\n[2377.5s - 2385.7s]: If you want to check it out in social media. And yeah, that's exciting. I think we'll try to get that out there through the Wyners platform as well.\n\n[2386.0s - 2393.7s]: Yeah, well, you can, you can upload it. It's for everyone. It doesn't have a copyright and one can use it.\n\n[2393.7s - 2408.7s]: And that's important, not just detecting the need of having this kind of symbol, but it's important is having the humbleness to explain people and they really want to embrace it.\n\n[2408.8s - 2422.0s]: Because if it's a symbol without the embracement of a community, it's nothing. But these are all say that says that revolution comes with a symbol like we'd.\n\n[2423.3s - 2437.8s]: And I sense that if we are in this environmental revolution, we need more flags that represent us. And like over the world, like we need to be more unified and understanding.\n\n[2438.8s - 2447.3s]: That is the only way to change things, like to change us. Because is this spirit changing us to change the world?\n\n[2447.6s - 2459.4s]: That's beautiful. That's exciting. It gives me hope. All right. Revolution comes with a symbol. Yes. That is beautiful. I can just visualize it all over the place.\n\n[2459.4s - 2472.3s]: Yeah. Well, I don't have my phone is dead, but if not, I show you is a beautiful color. Each layer should represent a compromise by our own.\n\n[2472.8s - 2485.0s]: Like me, it tried to compromise in protecting biodiversity and like water rights and ocean conservancy. But if someone like these biologists experts, any of that we have that love,\n\n[2485.0s - 2500.9s]: that we have that we represent like love to mushrooms and protection to them. And if these guys, the coral guy that restore coral once coral that everyone can do something in each color should represent something personal.\n\n[2500.9s - 2520.6s]: Because nature is all about that about making it personal and making memories around it. Because that's the big situation we're having in years to tell people our nature experiences.\n\n[2520.6s - 2530.0s]: Like look, sir, it will be everywhere anywhere like that saying I was in the 2019 version of festival.\n\n[2530.4s - 2531.1s]: Yeah.\n\n[2532.2s - 2549.3s]: I think that's different. Like I was in the first international climate strike with this girl that came from Europe all the way, like an fairy tale to change the intake over three thousand people in New York.\n\n[2549.3s - 2560.2s]: Like so, 350,000. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Right to be a part of that. Yeah. That history. Yeah. That's a big part of our story. Yeah. These are the good old days. Yeah.\n\n[2560.4s - 2571.2s]: They tell the good day of days. When I met the the artist in New York, she told me like you came all the way from Mexico to Strague and New York.\n\n[2571.2s - 2589.4s]: And what I explain to her is like we should be for more more countries over here. Because in a certain way with our platform and like me as a youth leader in Mexico, I was the eyes of a country over there.\n\n[2589.5s - 2598.5s]: Yes. Right. And sometimes people is nervous about what's happening and they want you to feel alone.\n\n[2598.5s - 2614.2s]: But after New York, I know that I'm not alone. It's a whole bunch of us. Yeah. That's beautiful. And it's cool to have that kind of a conventions because it's like charging yourself not with like the power and with love and with knowledge.\n\n[2614.2s - 2631.2s]: Because a lot of people over there have not have knowledge. So I think we have to continue in pulsing these kind of activities that bring us together like strikes like conventions and people laugh about that because there's a lot of strikes, a lot of conventions, but you're not changing stuff.\n\n[2631.6s - 2643.5s]: I know we're changing. I've seen little eyes, little children eyes. And I know what they're feeling. And I would love to feel that when I was 15.\n\n[2644.5s - 2659.0s]: Absolutely. That's beautiful. Yeah. It's very powerful. Yeah. What's happening now? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm struck. I'm really curious and interested in language. And I'm struck by your use of the term compromise.\n\n[2659.0s - 2671.3s]: Because it's a little different than I think how many of us would use the term here in the United States and compromise often ends up carrying this sort of negative connotation like in the political realm.\n\n[2671.6s - 2681.1s]: But I was thinking when we break the word down, there's the word promise. And the calm is like with. Yeah. And it's almost like you're making a promise with somebody, right? Yeah.\n\n[2681.1s - 2696.2s]: Tell us more about what this word means for you. Yeah. Well, in Mexico, it's compromiso is when you love something so much that you get so attached.\n\n[2696.8s - 2706.5s]: You don't want to move from it. Like we say the wedding ring. We say, El Amigo compromiso.\n\n[2706.5s - 2717.9s]: So like compromise ring over. So imagine that's the feeling like being together, like promise to nature that we will be together. And we will be like.\n\n[2718.5s - 2732.8s]: And it's not a negative connotation, but compromise comes with responsibility. Absolutely. And that's why people sometimes fail this way that like these negative sides, but responsibilities.\n\n[2735.3s - 2749.0s]: It's something we have to understand as humans that comes with the rights of nature. If you are blessed with this nature, you should have the responsibility to protect it.\n\n[2749.0s - 2762.8s]: And you should have the responsibility to know your own resources and your own capacities to be part of this movement. And I believe so environmentalist.\n\n[2763.0s - 2773.3s]: We understand each other that we are like dead trees parts that if we brought all together, we will we will make it and the time is running.\n\n[2773.3s - 2780.3s]: So yeah, yeah, that's beautiful. Well, Adrian Alex, it has been such a joy to have this opportunity.\n\n[2780.4s - 2791.7s]: Thank you. Meeting you and having some wonderful conversations over the last couple of days and to have this opportunity to share some of your story and your projects with our audience.\n\n[2791.7s - 2805.7s]: And before we sign off, I just want to make sure and we're in no rush. I just want to make sure we have an opportunity if there's anything else you want to share or anything else you'd like to call to action.\n\n[2806.2s - 2807.6s]: Well, you'd like to share with the audience.\n\n[2807.6s - 2823.5s]: I would like to share like I was traveling a lot around the world and I'm getting back to Mexico to use all these knowledge to empower our country, our states, our endangered species.\n\n[2823.5s - 2834.5s]: So anyone that really wants to connect with these awesome nature, they will be really received in our home.\n\n[2835.2s - 2850.2s]: Like our home is everyone home. We don't have boundaries. We don't have boundaries. So we're open to everyone that wants to help and connect and understand nature and have this sense about what we're changing and what we're fighting for.\n\n[2850.2s - 2863.6s]: It includes you to like I hope because I'm going out with a lot of countries to bring my energy to them. So I'm inspecting everyone to get this energy back to Mexico.\n\n[2864.0s - 2869.9s]: Yeah, I like it. It's reciprocity. And we have really good food. Really great food and music.\n\n[2869.9s - 2875.4s]: Excellent. Yeah, well, I'm hoping to take you up on this pretty soon. So we'll see how that goes.\n\n[2876.2s - 2879.9s]: Yeah, well, thanks Adrian Alex. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\n[2880.0s - 2884.7s]: Thank you everyone. Yeah, absolutely. Great. All right.
