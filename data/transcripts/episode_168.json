  "full_transcript": "[11.0s - 25.1s]: Welcome to the Y on Earth Community Podcast. I'm your host, Aaron William Perry. And today we're visiting with Ken LaRoe, the founder and chairman of Climate First Bank. Hi Ken, how you doing?\n\n[27.3s - 28.7s]: Excellent, and you?\n\n[29.7s - 44.9s]: Doing great. And so excited to chat with you today, especially giving the amazing work and impact you and your colleagues are having with Climate First Bank. It's just an extraordinary story.\n\n[47.9s - 60.0s]: It's really been a journey and I must say a fulfilling journey and a bucket list dream come true that I didn't really know I had in my bucket.\n\n[62.5s - 64.4s]: Wonderful. Yeah, that's great.\n\n[65.9s - 77.2s]: Ken LaRoe is an award-winning sustainability professional and internationally recognized leader in the field of ethical banking who has dedicated his life to environmental activism and building businesses.\n\n[77.2s - 94.4s]: After successfully launching scaling and exiting two banks in central Florida, Ken opened Climate First Bank on June 1, 2021. The world's first FDIC-insured digital community bank founded to combat the climate crisis.\n\n[94.4s - 112.6s]: In just three years, Climate First Bank has grown to over $700 million in assets, has provided access to solar power to more than 2000 households, and has raised around $80 million in capital, making it one of the fastest growing banks in the United States.\n\n[113.6s - 130.5s]: Ken also personally lives out his bank's mission of environmental sustainability. As a committed environmentalist, he served as a chairman of Preserve Lake, a political action committee that passed a bond referendum for $36 million to purchase public land.\n\n[130.5s - 147.8s]: He later served the Lake County Commission as chairman of the Public Lands Acquisition Advisory Committee and was a founding member of the North American chapter of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, which I'm really excited to talk about.\n\n[147.8s - 159.6s]: He also served on the Board of Directors of the Global Alliance banking on Values from 2014 to 2016, and again in 2024.\n\n[175.1s - 188.6s]: Ken was awarded the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year. Wow, this is quite an amazing summary of your CV.\n\n[189.6s - 211.0s]: And rare in my experience anyway that will have such an accomplished banker doing also so much in the arena of environmental stewardship, and also now of course through Climate First Bank, you are deploying a whole lot of capital right into solutions.\n\n[211.0s - 221.8s]: Ken, can you tell us to give folks an impression of what's different and what's happening with Climate First Bank? Can you tell us a bit about what's going on with the company?\n\n[223.0s - 241.2s]: Sure, as you know, Aaron, we've talked before, this is the third bank I've done, the first one I started in 99 and sold at 06 and it was just a standard Florida started up scale at exit, make a bunch of people a bunch of money.\n\n[241.8s - 259.5s]: The second one was a result of after I sold that bank and working out my non compete period, my wife and I got a mini motorhome and we circumnavigated the country and my brother gave me Evon Chinard's autobiography, let my people go surfing.\n\n[261.2s - 278.8s]: And Evon for any delisor is Evon Chinard is a founder of Patagonia and I thought oh my god, this is it, this is the answer to my questions and what was bugging me at the time of what do I do with the rest of my life instead of just making a bunch of people.\n\n[278.8s - 302.0s]: And that was the genesis of first green bank so that was in we opened in 2009 right at the trough of the recession and there really wasn't a value space banking movement per se there was a few little smattering around the globe.\n\n[303.0s - 308.3s]: So it was really a learning journey and it was a fabulous learning journey for me and my folks.\n\n[310.1s - 327.0s]: We went through the recession and all the economic meltdown all the while learning a lot of great stuff and in my relationship with the global alliance for bank and values was a huge help in that space.\n\n[327.0s - 339.8s]: And we pioneered the first I think it was the first in the country residential solar loan program back in 2009 and we kept refining and refining and refining.\n\n[340.9s - 349.2s]: We sold that bank in 2018 that I did another cross country trip a whole bunch of soul searching basically.\n\n[351.5s - 364.2s]: Am I too old you know that was what I wrestled with every day I'm just too old this is this is really hard it's and then my my wife and my soulmate doctor send you a row.\n\n[366.3s - 380.7s]: Convince me and it was convincing a lot of arm twisting look you've you got it in you've got unfinished business you need to do this you need to do another bank and you need to do it no compromise in your face.\n\n[380.7s - 393.7s]: And starting with the name and it needs to be climate first bank and she she came up with the name so that was the most prescient business decision we made because every single day it plays out.\n\n[394.0s - 400.7s]: You know every single day we get somebody that says I'm moving my banking over to you.\n\n[400.7s - 412.7s]: I've been driving by your sign every day for six months I'm moving all my stuff from Bank of America because you believe what I believe in conversely it's like every day somebody says.\n\n[413.8s - 427.7s]: I'm not going to come bank with you with all that woke shit you guys are doing and we say fine there's you know plenty of people out there that that value it or we get the guy that says you know all that.\n\n[427.7s - 444.8s]: Climate stuff that's a hoax but I'm banking with you anyway because I love your service and that's probably the best scenario we could hope for because a big part of our mission is to influence an educator educate and influence whichever way you want to look at it.\n\n[447.4s - 474.7s]: Beautiful well I'm really thrilled Ken that we've connected here summer of 2024 because as I understand that you guys have just hit a very significant milestone which means you're about to reach a whole lot more people educating influencing and deploying a whole lot more capital can you walk us through a little bit that process with the\n\n[474.7s - 479.5s]: federal regulators and what that means now that you're out of the denovo period.\n\n[480.5s - 494.1s]: Yes and honestly before I did my first bank I didn't know what the novo math and so I had to look it up and it means what comes before or something like that.\n\n[494.1s - 505.3s]: And so there's a regulatory period of heightened scrutiny the last three years after the day you open so we've been we made it through there June 1st was the date.\n\n[506.7s - 524.0s]: The federal regulators didn't want us expanding outside the state of Florida until we got through with the novo so immediately upon getting out we've expanded our residential solar program into.\n\n[524.0s - 543.0s]: To eight other states than Florida and now we're going through the process of licensing and in the other states and all that the ultimate goal is to be in all 50 states by the end of this year with our residential solar product and our our business solar product.\n\n[543.0s - 552.8s]: Which is fully digitized anybody can go online in in three minutes fill out an application in 30 seconds have a.\n\n[553.0s - 570.1s]: A credit decision we have been banking customers nationwide the whole time through our online account opening and online banking and we have customers in 49 states and in three countries now.\n\n[570.1s - 600.1s]: Puerto Rico France and England so it's it's been kind of amazing and in the digital space we've had to write all our own proprietary code because small banks community banks are beholden to the core processing system that we have to buy and then any API that will allegedly talk to it and I say allegedly because.\n\n[600.1s - 629.1s]: They never do very well so I kind of boast that our online banking is almost as good as a capital one experience not to put in a plug for our competitors but we're getting better and and we will we will get there and we joke that our service is almost as good as Ritz Carlton but we hope to pass them someday so.\n\n[629.7s - 632.8s]: It's all part of the learning journey if you will.\n\n[634.2s - 659.1s]: Absolutely love it and you know the the the personable demeanor you know by which you represent the company as founder and chairman is so delightful and so authentic i've had the pleasure of interacting with some of the other team as well over the last several weeks and folks are genuinely really friendly and.\n\n[659.1s - 669.1s]: And helpful and you know it's some of my other friends and colleagues in the in the world of banking I wouldn't say necessarily carry that same level of.\n\n[670.6s - 678.5s]: Joy and some patico and that's that's amazing right that's just an amazing thing to experience it with our banking partners.\n\n[681.0s - 700.3s]: Thank you for that but I think a lot of it is just getting old the wisdom thing does increase with age i'm quite convinced at least i've experienced it my dad told me that it would and it's like.\n\n[700.3s - 702.3s]: Thank God.\n\n[704.9s - 716.3s]: I thought we had a good culture in my last bank but that was only because I didn't know what good culture was and this bank is defined good culture oh my gosh it's.\n\n[717.0s - 728.5s]: I think you hit the nail on the head you said you've had exchanges with some of my co workers and they're amazing I mean they are amazing I get accolades all the time.\n\n[728.5s - 748.0s]: And in our last staff meeting I think our last one or the one before I just gotten like four accolades that week and I told my team I said you guys are amazing we haven't even done formal customer service training in this bank yet you all get it somewhat somehow intuitively.\n\n[748.0s - 764.6s]: And they really really do and when we screw up it's just like everybody owns it they don't it's just amazing and I don't know entirely what is caused it it's.\n\n[765.5s - 778.6s]: A lot of my same team that was with me with the last bank is rejoined you know is it the 30 year overnight sensation or the three times the charm or or what you know I.\n\n[778.6s - 794.2s]: But I know a lot of it is the values proposition almost every new person that has joined us has stated in the interview the reason they're there is because of our values proposition.\n\n[796.8s - 824.1s]: So exciting one of the things I've been thinking in talking a lot about and in fact is one of the threads in our in our forthcoming book is this idea that the notion of competitive advantage is really transforming before our very eyes of us living and working right now in these times as environmental stewardship and the social responsibility factor more and more into our business decisions into our consumer purchasing decisions.\n\n[824.1s - 839.2s]: And it seems to me that what you're doing at climate first bank exemplifies just that and I'm not surprised to hear what you're describing with respect to the value proposition and holy smokes.\n\n[839.2s - 868.5s]: You know you say you're you're busy and have a lot going on these past few years but I imagine things are really about to skyrocket for you guys given the the national scope now and that this is probably going to catch on in a really big way word of mouth and otherwise what are you anticipating as you're looking out ahead over the coming quarters and next few years.\n\n[870.7s - 893.2s]: The growth trajectory really drives a lot and in banking it's a highly regulated industry and a highly regulated and just highly regulated the easy metric to think about is you can only grow your total assets 10 times your capital.\n\n[893.2s - 921.6s]: So we're as of today we're 730 million in assets we raised as you pointed out 79 million initially so you can see we're like right at that 10 times the worst thing that could happen would be that we have to slow down and constrain growth especially when the growth is in such cool things as solar renewable energy finance.\n\n[923.3s - 950.6s]: Building energy retrofits eSOP banking we do a lot of eSOP banking all the stuff that we're really making an impact in it would just be ashamed to have to slow it down so we're in another capital raise right now I really would like to raise 50 million we've been at it seven weeks and have a little shy of 7 million.\n\n[951.9s - 981.6s]: In and in signed commitments or signed us the description agreements so about a million dollars a week it's not bad but we do need to try to raise as much as possible and then our plan is to go public in 2025 or 2026 that's a multifaceted logic stream behind that not the least of which is the ability to raise more capital is it's all like\n\n[981.6s - 994.7s]: capital driven thing but if we are publicly traded it would give us a larger platform or larger bully pulpit if you will size is a big big important factor.\n\n[994.7s - 1016.5s]: So that's kind of the future while of course maintaining the highest level of safety and soundness we can maintain that it won't it would really get our values proposition if we didn't perform at a high financial level including safety and soundness.\n\n[1018.8s - 1040.3s]: I got to ask you a little bit of a geeky question about safety and soundness in a few minutes I'm going to wait though and first ask you know you mentioned the eSOP banking which is the employee stock ownership plans that many companies are now utilizing to further incentivize and share the wealth with their teams.\n\n[1041.0s - 1061.7s]: And of course the bank is a certified B Corp and is also part of the 1% for the planet ecosystem and I want to talk a little more about what that means in terms of the global network and landscape but I'm really curious with respect to the commitments you've made you know above and beyond\n\n[1063.7s - 1076.5s]: maximizing profit what does that look like for you as you're laying the groundwork and preparing for an IPO is it is it something that's really difficult to navigate it is it is it fairly straightforward.\n\n[1078.3s - 1096.1s]: That's a really really good question we're also a Florida legal benefits corporation public benefits corporation we're the only bank in the state that is in one of the few in the country and most dates now have the public benefit status.\n\n[1098.0s - 1126.1s]: But we think and our investment banker thinks that being certified by third party certifiers like B labs 1% for the planet all of the various vetting processes we've gone through the global lines for banking on values will actually help\n\n[1126.1s - 1154.7s]: when we when we go public that there's enough demand out there and enough generational cohort change to be to drive a better valuation because of it and I mean I believe it in my heart of hearts but then I've gotten all this verification through our investment bankers and stuff.\n\n[1154.7s - 1170.8s]: And there are some a couple of B core benefit corpse that have gone public and they're doing they do very well and they're doing very well and they did very well in their IPO.\n\n[1172.8s - 1176.6s]: So did that answer your question was that response?\n\n[1176.8s - 1200.1s]: Yeah, yeah, I it definitely answers part of it and it sort of I think implicitly answers the other part which was I was wondering if you had to jump through certain hoops or somehow bridge the gap when Wall Street in general as I understand it is looking primarily and often exclusively for maximize profits.\n\n[1200.1s - 1211.4s]: Right. How does that get reconciled as you're shifting toward you know triple bottom line and social and environmental performance in addition to the financial performance.\n\n[1212.0s - 1228.9s]: Well, I think the solution to that or the answer that is we believe that we don't have to sacrifice financial performance to do good and I personally am not that's not acceptable to me personally.\n\n[1228.9s - 1235.7s]: I know almost all of our shareholders we have five 180 something shareholders.\n\n[1236.3s - 1253.7s]: They are friends and family if they weren't friends when they invested they frequently become friends and I have a responsibility to them to maximize their return and and to go way beyond doing no harm.\n\n[1253.7s - 1263.4s]: You know, it's not just a function of doing no harm. It's it's a function of actually doing good in the world, whatever, however that is defined.\n\n[1264.6s - 1277.0s]: And I believe that if we don't put financial performance on the board that's that's highest in class that it diminishes everything.\n\n[1277.0s - 1282.9s]: Right. I mean it diminishes people can take shots at shot shots at you then.\n\n[1283.9s - 1292.5s]: And if you look back at the Milton Friedman mentality of of shareholder primacy.\n\n[1293.1s - 1301.7s]: I mean I was used to think well he's just a bad guy. You know he's wrong headed. He was a bad guy. It's just it's all wrong.\n\n[1301.7s - 1317.1s]: But the more I think about it maybe that's not the case. You know at the time he was postulating that thesis which which became the Chicago school and all that.\n\n[1317.1s - 1329.6s]: I mean it was a period of of unprecedented natural resources a period of of I mean there was no labor shortage right.\n\n[1330.6s - 1342.4s]: But there was a capital of the capital constraints. So you know maybe he was just a product of his time maybe he was a product of of of that situation.\n\n[1343.0s - 1348.4s]: But we're in a space now between stories right.\n\n[1350.0s - 1360.3s]: The old system is done. But it hasn't manifested in what the new economy is quite yet right.\n\n[1361.0s - 1362.7s]: So we can sit back.\n\n[1364.8s - 1371.9s]: You know from a distance and and say well I don't know where we're headed but I know the road we should take.\n\n[1373.1s - 1384.1s]: I'm really getting off track of what you asked me but I think the solution to the Wall Street question is we're going to put big numbers on the board anyway.\n\n[1384.8s - 1392.4s]: You know there's no margin without the mission in my mind and then the margin is better with the mission.\n\n[1392.4s - 1403.0s]: Yeah that's yeah that's beautiful and to me reinforces this notion of a dramatically shifting competitive advantage overall.\n\n[1403.3s - 1421.4s]: And I love the the background and the political economy in all of this with Milton Freeman and obviously several generations before him Adam Smith right who was a moral philosopher of all things and sort of took for granted several key.\n\n[1422.7s - 1450.1s]: Social and philosophical imperatives that would say we're treating each other well and we're treating our planet well by implication and yeah now that we're at a point in the development of the global economy and here in the United States where we've got to include a lot of other variables and factors to compete well and to perform well.\n\n[1450.1s - 1471.1s]: It gives me great hope that where we're headed although it might be a bit of a bumpy road where we're headed helps to harmonize the interests of financial performance environmental performance social performance and that perhaps in a number of years or hopefully a couple of short decades.\n\n[1471.1s - 1485.0s]: It's you know we'll look back and say wow it's wild that the previous several generations saw those three things as being so at odds with one another when in fact when this things well done they all go really well together.\n\n[1485.8s - 1495.9s]: Absolutely 100% it's it's all part of the same giant organism should be anyway.\n\n[1497.6s - 1525.2s]: Yeah absolutely well I got to ask this geeky question I grew up in a family my parents are entrepreneurial and had a mortgage banking company and so I had some idea of underwriting requirements and so forth and I'm really curious what kind of paper are you guys writing is your underwriting pretty conservative is it are you kind of middle of the road especially if you're working with\n\n[1526.0s - 1534.2s]: consumers homeowners helping them with solar are they very tight underwriting criteria or what does that look like.\n\n[1535.3s - 1553.8s]: I would say if you had to put it on a continuum we it would be pretty conservative and some of that as a function that were bankers and were traditionally trained and traditional underwriting but it's part of that whole thing of\n\n[1553.8s - 1578.4s]: where in the space between stories that it was always understood that while you get a credit score you look at debt income and you make a decision this is on the consumer side but then load a moderate income households you know wouldn't qualify and so therefore it locks out just a huge section of the population from even being able to get ahead.\n\n[1578.4s - 1602.2s]: And I mean again it's part of our learning journey we've started to learn through the help of some dear friends like Martin Eek set self help credit union or cat Taylor at beneficial state bank that there are other metrics there are other ways to look at things and still have fruit and sound underwriting\n\n[1602.2s - 1614.9s]: and so we are working on that diligently now we we kind of joke amongst ourselves that we do solar for the middle class really really well.\n\n[1615.8s - 1643.9s]: You're middleed up or income we got you you know and that's the easy underwriting we don't do solar for low to modern income well at all and that's the demographic that needs it the most the inflation reduction act and the in the greenhouse gas reduction fund should go a long way to solving that and we hope to be part of that.\n\n[1645.3s - 1671.0s]: But it's such things as we'll get an application that will have very good credit scores with the with the three traditional credit rating agencies and then I completely wonky debt income ratio you know it like it wouldn't work it just defies the laws of physics well how could somebody have a\n\n[1671.0s - 1700.9s]: 800 credit score but have a 90% debt to income you know they they couldn't survive financially well what it is is and then you look at their surname and it's Latin or it's a Middle Eastern or whatever and you go wait a minute something's going on here there's a there's a it's thematic you know it's it's it's an iterative it's it's a latin's their name is Latin surname is Latin surname is Latin surname is Latin.\n\n[1701.0s - 1726.0s]: What's going on well one thing a lot of immigrants first generation immigrants don't trust the government they don't trust banks they've got a W2 income somewhere but then they got a side hustle and they're not putting that side hustle on that application they they may be you know paying taxes on it or whatever but they're not putting it down on that application because they don't trust the banks.\n\n[1727.0s - 1755.9s]: They don't have an 80% debt income ratio it's really 30% or whatever and the default rate and the low to moderate income community is very very low and historically it was always thought to be very very high so gosh I'm getting off on a tangent again but and I geek out on this stuff so we have very very good credit quality.\n\n[1755.9s - 1784.9s]: And we have it all of my banks and I think that's a function of being fastidious and having systems and policies and procedures in place and following them and and all of that just boring blocking and tackling you know business stuff but we're not so high bound that we won't look at what it takes to a\n\n[1786.3s - 1790.5s]: accomplish our objectives from a mission perspective either.\n\n[1791.6s - 1812.6s]: Yeah it's so interesting I want to ask one other sort of geeky question and then we can move on to some other maybe more exciting topics but I'm curious do you guys hold on to all of the loans you originator do you move some of them to the secondary markets what does that look like for you guys.\n\n[1813.7s - 1839.1s]: We do residential lending and it's pretty much plain vanilla residential we do portfolio some of those but we also sell some of those in the secondary market in the solar space there's a gigantic it's kind of constrained right now but a gigantic secondary market that the fintechs have been selling those loans into for a number of years now.\n\n[1840.9s - 1861.6s]: But we were always told it takes tranches of at least a hundred million we have found that we can easily sell two million dollar tranches or three million and we've sold some of our solar loans off to other community banks mostly CDFI banks.\n\n[1861.6s - 1875.6s]: So the answer is yes we do sell some off we do participate some larger loans and participate out and participate in but the vast majority we keep on the portfolio.\n\n[1877.1s - 1887.5s]: Interesting and maybe as a way to transition toward some of the emerging indicators around this new economy that we're moving toward.\n\n[1887.5s - 1906.6s]: How do you foresee climate related and specifically carbon market related signals playing into your solar lending in the coming years is that something you're you're starting to anticipate.\n\n[1907.9s - 1929.2s]: And trying to anticipate as you know the carbon markets in the US just hasn't become what it should be and especially when you look at it in the context of the rest of the world especially Europe.\n\n[1929.2s - 1944.6s]: I mean we're staying on top of it and we really hope it happens but there's nothing at this point that it plays into our strategy.\n\n[1945.7s - 1967.6s]: Yeah yeah you will yeah that makes sense to me well you know we've had on the podcast other really notable leaders like our mutual friend Kate Williams who's CEO of 1% for the planet and of course Jorge Fountain is who's the CEO of B Lab for the United States and Canada.\n\n[1967.6s - 1986.0s]: And one of the things I'm so excited about is tracking the growth and development of those two ecosystems which now encompass many thousands of companies and similarly several thousand nonprofits as well NGOs.\n\n[1987.4s - 2009.3s]: How are those ecosystems as they're developing and expanding and growing in those companies are commanding more and more market share in their respective industries are they are you seeing a lot of them interested in banking with you and is there potentially a lot of synergy there that will kick in over the next few years.\n\n[2010.4s - 2038.6s]: I think it will grow significantly you've probably experienced the same thing I do it's kind of shocking to find out or to see people that don't know what the B Corp logo the circle with the B in it means or what 1% for the planet means and I'm thinking it's everywhere at least the B labs certifications everywhere on product labels and everything but.\n\n[2039.3s - 2047.8s]: And then when you tell people that don't know they're like hmm okay well that's kind of interesting whether they're.\n\n[2048.5s - 2066.1s]: You know believers are not but we think it's and as it becomes more and more understood that where you bank has more impact on your carbon footprint than almost anything else you do.\n\n[2067.0s - 2096.1s]: That's not widely understood yet either it's kind of like you know soil and soil health and the the micro organisms that how they impact the human organism it's all that stuff that's just barely we're barely starting to scratch the surface as more and more people realize what a big impact they're banking is I think they'll be moving to value space banks a lot more.\n\n[2096.1s - 2116.9s]: Or in fact B labs is going to start giving points for banking with a value space bank and I think 1% for the planet is going to also give credits for that like they give credits for labor if you do in kind.\n\n[2116.9s - 2142.6s]: And you know contributions or whatever and we do a lot of that for our 1% membership we we've been involved with Tampa Bay watch which is really cool nonprofit in the Tampa Bay area and and a lot of our team has gone out and done oyster you know reclamation projects and and all that kind of stuff.\n\n[2145.0s - 2152.3s]: So you know with the help of B labs and 1% for the planet I think it will even accelerate.\n\n[2153.7s - 2171.6s]: Yeah it's so exciting to think about these positive feedback loops you know I think those of us who have been looking at these systemic risks and what many refer to as the polypolli crisis we I can identify a whole bunch of negative feedback loops and.\n\n[2173.1s - 2202.4s]: What excites me really almost beyond words is the emergence of these positive feedback loops and you know this work you're doing as a as a leader in the values based banking arena is so tremendous and i'm hoping can you explain for us what the global alliance for banking on values is and does and seems like to me that's one of the one of the things more and more of us ought to be aware of.\n\n[2202.6s - 2219.3s]: Well it's it certainly is a shining light that's for sure the ironic thing was when I first started first green bank you came up with the concept was about two thousand seven.\n\n[2219.3s - 2230.9s]: And I and I thought well what can a bank do you know and so I just googled green banks and two banks popped up one was.\n\n[2231.8s - 2245.6s]: New resource bank in San Francisco which is now amalgamated another great value space bank and triados bank in the Netherlands and so I just reached out.\n\n[2245.6s - 2263.2s]: But research the CEO and reached out to him and says you what's your gig what what do you do what's different how are you making an impact and it was like okay well okay well i'll just build some of that into the business plan and the CEO of triados bank is a fellow named Peter Blom.\n\n[2264.5s - 2273.4s]: He's been CEO or had been CEO for a long long time he just retired maybe a year ago.\n\n[2274.7s - 2302.8s]: He's he's a young guy young I say little younger and I think in 2009 the same year we opened he formed the global lines for bank your values and he just called together a group of friends like minded bankers from around the world I think there were seven of them and said well let's do this organization for best practices less.\n\n[2302.8s - 2304.2s]: Let's try to.\n\n[2304.8s - 2329.4s]: You know do build something out of this I think we were maybe at first green we joined in 2012 after attending their conference in Vancouver and I think we may have been the 22nd member bank at that time now I think there's 74 banks worldwide.\n\n[2330.9s - 2359.3s]: I'm going through the map in my head of the globe I think we're on every continent it will accept Antarctica but amazing financial institutions doing amazing things unfortunately most of them are in the social space you know the S part of the SG and financial institutions.\n\n[2359.3s - 2376.3s]: And then poverty alleviation and that sort of thing but I think to the financial institution they want to do more environmental and we've gotten a lot of inquiry and you know can you help us what are you doing all that sort of thing.\n\n[2376.3s - 2405.6s]: I'm still not sure I answered the question but it's it's a group of financial institutions around the world I don't remember who the largest is at this point we pale in comparison to a a Wells or a chase or a B of A in size cumulatively we have a pretty good size and pretty good.\n\n[2406.9s - 2426.9s]: Pretty big dollar assets and a lot of co workers worldwide but I our impact is far far greater than any of the two big to fail I think the biggest institution is probably Van City Credit Union they may be 18 20 billion in assets I'm not sure.\n\n[2429.4s - 2430.1s]: Interesting.\n\n[2434.7s - 2460.0s]: You know it's to me remarkable that you are doing so much innovative and trailblazing work in the in the financial sector in the environmental sector the social sector and you're doing all this in Florida which I know is one of the most populated states in the world.\n\n[2460.8s - 2489.4s]: It's an incredible diversity of people and world views and so forth and I also know that politically Florida is well how do we say it maybe not the most progressive state in the union as of today and so I'm really curious what what is that like for you as a as a business leader as an entrepreneur doing what you're doing in in that environment has it been.\n\n[2489.4s - 2496.4s]: And you know challenging is it straightforward is it sometimes funny sometimes frustrating.\n\n[2502.8s - 2525.1s]: My friend cat Taylor at beneficial state banks said well can you're just a missionary in the jungle you just you're you're doing you know the good work it's like okay well as long as you keep telling me that maybe you'll convince me someday but it's it's a challenge it's it's.\n\n[2525.9s - 2553.2s]: I mean a lot of times I sit back and go this is just ridiculous but I don't know I've had this dream that people come into Florida go oh my gosh look at all the solar on rooftops I wonder how that happened and say well there's this really cool bank that you know finance it all ethically and morally unlike all the fintechs that are very predatious slimy operators.\n\n[2553.2s - 2583.2s]: I could name them but I won't but it the laws are extremely regressive they're extremely unconstitutional they're extremely not capitalist I mean I don't I just can't I just can't explain how ridiculous it is here but we just keep plowing ahead they pay.\n\n[2583.2s - 2610.4s]: I asked the anti sg bill last year house bill three that prevents a bank or financial institution from discriminating against any person person defined as the citizens united you know corporation is a per for political ideological you know they give a laundry list.\n\n[2612.7s - 2638.0s]: So you know it's it's like I said it's unconstitutional like the don't say gay bills and they'll get you know over time it'll get shipped away they'll get defeated in courts of law all over the place as long as we have any faith in the judicial system that's another whole topic I think.\n\n[2638.9s - 2666.4s]: Yeah, I don't get to the US Supreme Court put it that way hey we could have a long conversation about that I'm sure let me can let me remind our audience this is the why on earth community podcasts on your host Aaron William Perry today we're visiting with Ken LaRoe the founder and chairman of climate first bank you can find climate first bank on the web at climate first bank.com.\n\n[2666.4s -

2748.6s]: Edafic solutions Josephine Porter Institute Wele Waters profitable purpose consulting earth coast productions and soil works and of course a huge thanks to our growing global network of ambassadors and folks who contribute to the why on earth community on a monthly basis.\n\n[2749.2s -

2815.8s]: extraordinary work with women and girls and young boys and men. And we just helped\n\n[2815.8s - 2821.9s]: launch a GoFundMe to raise some money for Sarah and her team to get me where\n\n[2821.9s - 2827.2s]: equipment and help more people in the communities and schools throughout rural\n\n[2827.2s - 2832.6s]: Uganda where she's working. You'll find info on our blog page at YHONORF.org.\n\n[2832.7s - 2836.7s]: You'll see a wonderful video about this. And if you go to GoFundMe, you'll find\n\n[2836.7s - 2845.3s]: mantle of hope under the Empower Ugandan Women Keyword Search. Of course, a\n\n[2845.3s - 2853.0s]: huge thanks to climate first bank for all you guys are doing Ken and we're\n\n[2853.0s - 2858.9s]: thrilled to help spread the word and want to encourage folks to check it out.\n\n[2858.9s - 2863.3s]: Check out climate first bank and think about moving your money, moving your\n\n[2864.8s - 2872.0s]: loan needs over to Ken and his team to help with these positive feedback loops\n\n[2872.0s - 2878.0s]: that we're talking about. And Ken, you know, picking up on this thread of some of\n\n[2878.0s - 2884.8s]: the dynamics you're experiencing in Florida and reflecting on, you know, many of\n\n[2884.8s - 2888.9s]: our international partners with the work that we're doing through the YHONORF\n\n[2888.9s - 2897.4s]: community, you know, the United Nations is engaged in so many great initiatives\n\n[2897.4s - 2901.7s]: worldwide and collaborating with so many wonderful nonprofits and other\n\n[2901.7s - 2905.4s]: organizations. And of course, here in the United States, there are a lot of folks\n\n[2905.4s - 2911.5s]: who have some real misconceptions about what the United Nations is up to. But what\n\n[2911.5s - 2916.7s]: I wanted, which basically our nation helped to create, I wanted to ask you\n\n[2916.7s - 2922.8s]: specifically about one of the UN initiatives that you're connected to, which\n\n[2922.8s - 2927.8s]: is the UNEP Finance Initiative, the United Nations Environment Program Finance\n\n[2927.8s - 2934.4s]: Initiative. Can you explain to us what that is and how that's relevant for\n\n[2934.4s - 2938.2s]: climate first bank and what you're doing lending here in this domestic\n\n[2938.2s - 2948.9s]: context? Well, we were actually involved with our last bank was when it kind of got\n\n[2948.9s - 2957.0s]: started. And I'd say it was, you know, fits and starts that never, never really got\n\n[2957.0s - 2965.2s]: terribly, you know, launched. But I think now it kind of goes back to your\n\n[2965.2s - 2971.1s]: question on the carbon markets thing and the, you know, carbon trading. It's\n\n[2971.1s - 2976.0s]: starting to get traction, the Nesero Banking Alliance, they're getting\n\n[2976.0s - 2982.2s]: commitments, especially from the large banks to reduce their carbon footprint,\n\n[2982.4s - 2994.4s]: which is a very complicated thing to do. As you know, the scope one, two and three\n\n[2994.4s - 3003.0s]: emissions and how you measure it, how you actually impact it is, it's maybe a\n\n[3003.0s - 3007.3s]: little bit, it's maybe pretty straightforward for a manufacturing company or an\n\n[3007.3s - 3012.6s]: operating company, but for a bank, it's really, really difficult with thousands\n\n[3012.6s - 3020.2s]: and tens of thousands of customers and different businesses and how do you\n\n[3020.2s - 3026.5s]: collect the data and all of that. So a lot of our involvement is from that\n\n[3026.5s - 3036.9s]: perspective of we we want to do is as good as we can do, but it's the it's being\n\n[3036.9s - 3042.6s]: able to quantify that through data and, you know, thank goodness there's an\n\n[3042.6s - 3048.0s]: initiative like that and thank goodness there's United Nations that can\n\n[3048.0s - 3060.2s]: impact and draw in companies from all across the world to where we can maybe\n\n[3060.2s - 3070.5s]: piggyback, piggyback is the right word onto it. So that's kind of the where it\n\n[3070.5s - 3074.8s]: really the positive impact that comes out of that. I'm not sure if I answered\n\n[3074.8s - 3080.7s]: the question adequately or not, but yeah, it helps. Thank you. That definitely helps\n\n[3080.7s - 3086.4s]: me form a bit more of a picture about what what that's about and I what I\n\n[3086.4s - 3091.9s]: might do is see if we can include a link to that finance initiative in the\n\n[3091.9s - 3097.6s]: show notes in case folks would like to learn more. You know, you and your team\n\n[3097.6s - 3103.9s]: can provided me your 2023 impact report summary before our discussion today and\n\n[3103.9s - 3110.2s]: I was struck to see that already you guys again, you're only three years into\n\n[3110.2s - 3115.0s]: this with climate first bank, you've already originated over $150 million in\n\n[3115.0s - 3119.4s]: loans for mission driven projects and companies you're working with a\n\n[3119.4s - 3126.9s]: regenerative farm in Georgia. You have contributed, you have donated over\n\n[3128.1s - 3134.9s]: $213,000 to date to a variety of causes as well. I mean, you guys are walking the\n\n[3134.9s - 3141.8s]: talk to be sure. Can you can you give us a glimpse into what that looks like for\n\n[3141.8s - 3146.5s]: you and your team and how you're thinking about projects and ways you can have\n\n[3146.5s - 3152.4s]: input impact as you're going forward and as you're scaling. Well, the amazing thing\n\n[3152.4s - 3160.3s]: is those numbers that were in the impact report is how rapidly everything's\n\n[3160.3s - 3167.5s]: progressing and I think as of today we're probably 150 million in just solar.\n\n[3168.5s - 3175.8s]: We're probably I don't even I'll get the number wrong but probably 50 million\n\n[3175.8s - 3186.9s]: in ESOP. It's just it's 10 million here 10 million there, 10 20 million and\n\n[3186.9s - 3206.2s]: you know, whatever category, healthcare, education, NGO, banking, it's just the\n\n[3206.2s - 3215.1s]: numbers become staggering really quickly but we we consider it in every\n\n[3215.1s - 3221.0s]: decision that we make. You know, whether it's the long product, whether it's the\n\n[3221.0s - 3227.6s]: underwriting, whether it's on the deposit side, how can we structure a product\n\n[3227.6s - 3234.7s]: that gives back like our regeneration account or pride account for the LGBTQ\n\n[3234.7s - 3243.1s]: community. I mean, it literally everything we do is is looked at through the lens of\n\n[3243.2s - 3254.5s]: a VSG and and how we can make a difference. And while while making a dollar while turning\n\n[3254.5s - 3260.5s]: in really stellar financial performance. Yeah, that's fabulous. You know, I know when\n\n[3260.5s - 3265.9s]: when you and I chatted the other day, you you shared with me that you're a a staunch.\n\n[3265.9s - 3269.1s]: I think you might use the word like rabbit or something. I'll just use the word you're\n\n[3269.1s - 3276.8s]: a staunch environmentalist and you're a staunch capitalist. And before we wrap up our\n\n[3276.8s - 3282.1s]: our interview today and transition to our behind the scenes segment for our ambassador\n\n[3282.1s - 3286.6s]: network and folks, if you haven't yet joined the ambassador network and you'd like to, you\n\n[3286.6s - 3293.2s]: will get a lot of additional benefits including access to our behind the scenes chats with\n\n[3293.2s - 3299.2s]: our podcast guests. We'll we'll dive into some of this a bit more, but I'm really curious.\n\n[3299.6s - 3306.7s]: Can if you'd share with our audience before we wrap up here. How how do you get in this\n\n[3307.8s - 3316.2s]: field of work in the first place? Like what was it in your life path that pushed you in this\n\n[3316.2s - 3322.9s]: direction or or pulled you in this direction or invited you in this direction of doing\n\n[3322.9s - 3333.5s]: so much in the way of environmental and social good as you're working in banking and finance?\n\n[3335.0s - 3341.8s]: I wish I could say there was an epiphany moment, but there maybe was a bunch of little ones,\n\n[3342.0s - 3350.2s]: you know, I was born and raised in the same town I'm in right now. I'm used to floor to a small\n\n[3350.2s - 3358.1s]: agrarian town in central Florida. I live four miles from the house I grew up in and my dad grew up\n\n[3358.1s - 3367.1s]: in that he still lives in and it's a very regressive conservative community. I was a\n\n[3367.1s - 3375.0s]: Republican until I was 57 years old and then I'd burn my voter card on video and put it on\n\n[3375.2s - 3387.9s]: social media and became an instant pariah around here, but it's the party didn't represent me anymore.\n\n[3388.5s - 3396.2s]: I've always been an environmentalist and I've always loved to fish and I used to hunt. I don't\n\n[3396.4s - 3411.5s]: hunt really anymore, but it really it really probably the genesis was a dear friend that\n\n[3412.5s - 3420.4s]: became a dear friend 20 years ago who would challenge my belief systems which were pretty\n\n[3420.4s - 3430.0s]: wrong at the time and with a lot of love and compassion and I started thinking, yeah,\n\n[3432.0s - 3440.6s]: he's right on that and you know he's right on that and it really was a pretty gradual awakening.\n\n[3441.6s - 3449.0s]: Now I have grandchildren and it's like it becomes perfectly clear why I do what I do.\n\n[3451.4s - 3455.4s]: I just want there to be a planet for those little people.\n\n[3458.0s - 3465.3s]: Yeah, beautiful, beautiful. Well in our behind the scenes segment I'll ask you about some of the\n\n[3466.0s - 3471.1s]: really interesting looking things in your background, your office there. You've got helmets and\n\n[3471.1s - 3479.2s]: wheels and it looks like some artwork from grandchildren per chance and we'll ask about that, but\n\n[3480.0s - 3486.6s]: before we wrap up here our interview, can I just I want to thank you for taking the time to visit\n\n[3486.6s - 3493.7s]: with me and with us at the Y on Earth community and if there's anything else you'd like to share or\n\n[3494.4s - 3499.8s]: say with our audience before we sign off, please the floor is yours.\n\n[3501.4s - 3509.8s]: Well, thank you. I guess the main thing or it's kind of like what can we do in our life to\n\n[3510.4s - 3519.4s]: make a difference and the the biggest thing I can say is just vote with your wallet and my wife says\n\n[3519.4s - 3529.2s]: everything she won't buy anything unless she knows where it's going to end up and if it's going\n\n[3529.2s - 3536.1s]: ultimately end up in a landfill she just doesn't have any interest in buying it. If it's a consumable\n\n[3536.1s - 3547.5s]: you know maybe but just vote with your wallet. Beautiful. We can congratulations on all of your\n\n[3547.5s - 3553.6s]: amazing growth and success with Climate First Bank and thanks again for joining us today. It's been\n\n[3553.6s - 3562.3s]: wonderful.
