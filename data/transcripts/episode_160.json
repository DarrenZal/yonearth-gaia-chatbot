  "full_transcript": " Welcome to the Why on Earth Community Podcast. I'm your host, Aaron William Perry. And today, we have the opportunity to visit with my dear friends and the co-founders of the Lucile Foundation, Sophie Mumpison and Olivia. And I'm very excited to be here with you today. Thank you for having us. Thank you, Aaron. And thank you to the Why on Earth community. We're thrilled to have shared this moment with you. We've already been deep in collaboration over the past several months. And we're going to talk about a bit of that and have in front of us even more opportunities for collaboration. And I'm so excited that we get to share of it about the work you're doing, the deep vision you're holding, and the ways you're helping mobilize many of us worldwide around such a beautiful vision. We're happy to share about it. You know, it's a good story. Absolutely. Sophie Mumpison is co-founder and CEO of the Lucile Foundation. Her education background includes psychotherapy, musicology, pedagogy, and sofrology. We'll talk about sofrology. And she studied at the University of Paris and the Sarbonum among other institutions. She holds the vision of a society that lives in respect and integrity with itself, society and nature, close to her heart and strives to bring this vision to reality every day. She's passionate about growth and transformation and has been working in the field of consciousness since 1996. Olivia is the co-founder and chief operating officer of the Lucile Foundation and also the co-director and producer of the film called the 12th, which we'll talk about. Olivia's background is amazing in that it weaves gaming, media branding, business, and marketing together with now this consciousness and spiritual work that is being done presently. And both Sophie and Olivia have deep connections and personal relationships with several Indigenous wisdom traditions and Indigenous elders worldwide. And that has clearly formed a significant part of the fabric of knowledge and awareness that you all are working with and sharing with the world. So welcome. What a joy we have so many exciting things to talk about together. It's really great to have this time with you. I can't stop smiling so I'm definitely happy. Very excited. Wonderful. Well, I got to ask because I'm curious and I think it gives us a nice starting point. How did you two come together and how did all of this work that is the Lucile Foundation's offering to the world get started? So we met 17 years ago through workshop initiation. We call that workshop in Europe. It's more an initiation with a shaman and for the strong session. And we have said that we didn't see each other for 12 years. Not one communication. And we met again, when no other initiation in the forest. And at that point, it was kind of obvious that we had something to do together. Absolutely. And we don't want to give the impression that Lucile was co-founded by only two people. We were actually nine co-founding Lucile. And the the common denominator was the the spiritual tradition that we were all initiated deeply into. That at one point give us a sense of purpose and maybe a clear vision of the missions that we all had. And we thought there were too big to accomplish by ourselves. So we shared and we were all sharing that drive, you know, coming from different backgrounds to actually make a change to try to, you know, try that alternative life where you actually create the world that you'd like to live in. And we did that that's how it happened only on the premises though that the the foundation and the the organization itself and the way we lived our lives and were pioneer in the sense that we were clearly following the teachings from our spiritual traditions to operate. So the whole foundation and its organization and its processes have been bathing in spiritual technology and consciousness and alignment with universal principles. It's because everything we learn through our tradition and we are learning every day is through experience. So there's no dogmas, there's no books, there's no place of okay, let's share and let's talk. It's real about your experience. You take your own lessons and you you test you test them in real life and just to reconnect to primordial wisdom to every that we have always in us. That's it. And so that was it, that's how the foundation was founded with a first mission which was the most maybe the craziest challenge of them all, which was to find 12 elders that we didn't know out of eight billion people without any financial support except our savings. And doing it through guidance every step of the way and gathering them at the UN in New York in 2017 just one year after the beginning of the foundation. Yeah, so that was the and that that pretty much set up the pace and the and the ambitions and the proof of concept that everything's possible when you know when you're aligned with what is supposed to happen. I think the personal level I mean. Yes. And when you accept the lessons from the experience through the experience. Yeah. Yeah, when you when you get straight the full spectrum of experience, the good to bad and the spiritual. Yes, absolutely. Beautiful. And the inspiration and the guidance that clearly informs your work is profound and potent. And I imagine maybe for some in our audience, not something that we're accustomed to in our in our kind of day to day working lives. And I'm excited to dive into that a little more with you. And I want to first kind of ground the conversation in share by sharing my own personal experience. And I think that's a lot of things. Having met you about a year ago almost precisely a year ago plus or minus a few weeks, I think. And since that time, we've I've been part of a year long holistic holistic visions, training process curated and provided by the LCL foundation. And it has been an extraordinary experience, collaborating with an amazing array of leaders and change makers around the world. And of course, we had the opportunity to gather in person in Barcelona for the annual symposium last fall. And the way you have woven together so many disparate. Disciplines and wisdom traditions and personal practices to help us each become more proficient at collaborating in coherence with others. It is amazing. I mean, it's for me, it's been a life changer. And I mean that. And so I'm so thrilled that we have the opportunity to invite others in our audience to connect with the LCL foundation. And to discover and explore ways that they too can have this extraordinary experience. And to that point, I want to ask you guys, how what is the process like, you know, going from the inspiration and the guidance that clearly is coming from sources outside of your cells, at least the small cells, right? How is it translating that and kind of stepping that all down into, you know, putting together like training programs that have like weekly curricula and so on. That's a good question. Yes. So I remember the first time we received a guidance after the Council of 12 and above in 2017. It was what has been created by the elders, meaning recreating a new blueprint for humanity to go from a state of revolution to a state of evolution needs to get to practicality. How can we find a way to go from the spiritual to the practical to the everyday life for people to take action for people to get it to integrate spirituality in their everyday life. And at first we created symposium, first symposium, we actually liked that and we discovered after the two first symposium that we were not giving all the tools because we didn't know that we could first, we didn't know that it was a necessity as well. But we realized after those two symposiums that when people were gathering, there were always this little time of amazing expansion of mine and there's only one unity, beautiful. And at some point they were, oh yes, but maybe it was my idea or you know this this pull back of how we really together. And in 2020 we were all isolated, we couldn't do a symposium that year. And so it was a perfect time for us to put all that's created a CL, meaning the rituals, the practices, the learnings we put together in different modules for different teams to access, let's say the simplicity of work. We can have in our team, I'm saying simplicity is not always simple, but at least we have tools. Yeah, exactly what Sophie is saying, it was a journey. Yeah, we and really we have to be candid about it, things, we let things reveal themselves when the time is right. And sometimes we don't know exactly why we're doing things and we understand it once, you know, they kick in and they make complete sense and they complete something else that's been put on the on the way. So we progressively it's, you know, the foundation was started with the idea of bridging wisdom traditions with the West at a time where only a few people were actually doing the same thing. And then as with the COVID and the first two years that actually took off the wisdom traditions were more and more put forward, which was a blessing. And we were called by the next step through the guidance and the next step was distilling the essence because it's not about cultures, it's not about traditions, it's about primordial wisdom, it's about really practical stuff really. And you can't say easy because they're never easy to do, but they're they're actually simple in the way they're crafted, but have a huge impact. And so how do you distill the complex journey that our team went through by completely surrendering to faith and turning completely their life around and and really taking risks. You know, that's not the job, it's not a job for everyone. What we need is a methodology that applies to daily life and then eventually you get a big mission and you act on it, but that's it's not the goal is to actually live a better life that that actually respects the entirety of life and and all the inhabitants of planet earth animate and inanimate. It's so beautiful and I've already shared with so many professional colleagues the experience I've had in the training and have encouraged many people to connect themselves and have that experience themselves. And I know that you guys have put so much effort and intelligence these past several years into laying an incredible foundation. And now the vision for the coming few years is extraordinary also and very inspiring and involves 3% of us, right? Can you tell us a bit about this and tell us how every single one of us connected to this podcast connected connected to our organizations is basically being invited to participate in in what's coming. Yeah, thanks for the thanks for addressing the 3% so 3% in 2026. When we were looking for the those 12 elders to bring to the UN, we actually met a lot of different wisdom traditions and many spiritual guides and shaman. And most of them were really addressing the same challenge which was 2026 and the way humanity would be at a crossroads at this point and had a simple choice to make either live exactly the same way and get into a revolution taking it to the same exactly the same situation in maybe a hundred years or so. Or the choice of evolution which is changing perspectives and doing things in a different way that is more aligned with the universal principles and values and going to an evolution like an upward spiral. So that's the that deadline has always been very present for us and explains why we've generated so much energy into doing what we do because we're and we know that you know humanity in its whole cannot be shifted into some kind of different mindset in 2026. But following the principle of critical mass 3% is enough to actually start tilting the balance and this is what the universe is asking for just that the balance is is tilting a little bit. So that's the story about the 3% in 2026. Sophie will tell you more about what we're trying to convey for 2026. So the word consciousness is a lot for many people sometimes it's far too far too much. So it's maybe just a little awareness, you know getting into practicality of thinking differently. It's so easy when we go to do our shopping to think I'm going to buy those food those fruits and at some point realize oh but they're in plastic. It would be so nice if there would not be and we're not asking people you know to drive kilometers to find the place where they can find their vegetables with no plastics. But at least already thinking it would be so nice it's already an awakening it's already a level of awareness that maybe it's not totally normal that we are buying so much stuff a natural stuff with plastic. It's a little example of what could be a shift in consciousness and it's going in every layers of what we're doing how we consume how we think how we act how we talk to each other is going through the values principles we are putting into actions. Yeah the essence of it all is primal wisdom and primal wisdom is pretty much everything that is engraved in the universe that actually makes life more aligned therefore better for everyone. And it can be like so few things so many other things you know it can be just waking up and not listening to the news but instead listening to music to you know create that atmosphere it's it's how do you look at a rainy day do you think it's a sad thing or do you think it provides water to the to the earth and therefore is a blessing. How do you you know come to work what kind of mindset in very pragmatic ways can be applied from six years old to a 99 years old that would make your day better and would make everybody's day better and the world a better place very really that's the point of entry for us. And then that leads to much deeper work which you experience with holistic visions for example. For us is really to go from a state of fear to a state of love and a state of love is not not knowing what's happening in the world it's not denying what is happening we know what is happening because we have the feeling that we're going to be pushed until 2026 by nature by history. Sorry to see through things to force ourselves to to grow to force ourselves to stop thinking individually and to sing collectively how we can together transform this world how we can together be more attuned with the vibration of nature we are part of by the way. And you are asking Aaron how can people participate there's going to be a massive call for action yes but for the moment the ideas are bubbling up and we're really we're finding a lot of people on our way that have the expertise to actually make this possible make this this great ambition possible. And so that's what's happening at the moment is and we can say more but what we know is that you know anyone from why on earth that that has a an idea of a yeah I know how you can reach 3% of the population. I want to participate of course we're absolutely open to that but we'll definitely you know tell you more as soon as as we went through the the couple of workshops that we want to do around that but yeah it's a collective effort and it's it it could turn out to be something extremely fun and and irresistible and for everyone to join in into them yeah. A massive collective action even if it's for one day you know. Yeah love it one day one lifetime I I'm struck by the experience of evolving even further in this direction of more love less fear. One of the things I found that you did so beautifully in the training curriculum is we've been just enough of the science to help those of us who you know get a little more convinced with science part of what's happening and the experience we had especially in our small group that met weekly for a year is that you know our neuro biochemistry is a very important thing. We individually transformed in the way that we related to each other and the way that we collaborated with each other and we know in the science that there's something going on with the parasympathetic nervous system there's something going on with the neuro biochemistry and the endocrine system. And so the weaving of the science is brilliant and it's it's touches it's not this isn't a an end of scientific curriculum by any stretch it's an experiential curriculum and you know similarly this notion of the 3% this is from the science looking at adoption curves right of things like new technologies coming out the way that we're going to do that. Today we humans tend to move from the very earliest movers the the all on guard the trailblazers the ones that many of the rest of us might look at as being a little bit nuts and then suddenly you're at this critical mass of 3% and from there often with technology adoption and with awareness changes the rest of humanity already significant portion of her ponderance. And so the rest of us follow can you tell us a little more about what you're envisioning and what does it mean to create a conscious connection among 240 million human beings on on the planet in the next few years. Yeah, I think your first first you're right on point with the where you know I think we live in such exciting times because it's convergence right if you're really interested in science right now it's going to tell you exactly the same thing. Spirituality or primal wisdom has been saying for thousands of years or hundreds of years depending on the information and you know even even what you're talking about the fact that being in a group operating at the same vibrational level actually affects each and every one of you you can tie it to record shelter and and the fact that it might even not be the nervous system it might even be the water in your system. And so you know in our spiritual tradition in in Gabon. The spiritual tradition is called l'Acience the science and so you know everything is is is science if when the science is not something that you can do and you can't get it. And that is completely separated from nature from an and is more on it you know the Darwin is the pyramidal sense of man is is above everything in nature. So that's that's the first thing that's that's why it's it's part of our of our life and of the training program. The 3% and what it can look like or what it can feel like is is a big question and then and honestly do you have an answer I have I have so many I images and and you know emotions and and that come up. I have an answer. I go ahead. The first time we met Aaron we knew already that we're going to work together it was obvious it was a vibration it was stronger than a feeling it was a connection not through ideas but it was a hello from our souls. It's the way I felt it's the first time we talk together and I would say the same with everyone on the path of the three persons and sometimes it's. So that are less related or that are for further countries but it you can still recognize each other it's we are not on our own we are all together and it's really this time of urgency of let's do something. But not let's not do it for ourselves let's do it for the all let's do it for the greater good let's do it for all life and for the next generation and that for me is a is a fabric of the three persons. Yeah and even the name itself the three percent you know when we came up with that we didn't we didn't realize that that because that's how you know you know it as well as we do that's that that's how it it rolls right here the information comes to you and maybe you don't know why and and it makes sense but knowing how the world is talking about the one percent. You know that why not have a three percent counter buttons to that you know and being how exciting to be in a movement where you're in the street and you know that that person that actually you don't know but smiles at you in the street and in a completely natural way is definitely part of that movement and that you know did and that it can it can actually be shared through really. Simple things it we're not talking about hours of meditation all of that is is it's just the next levels that that you can go to but the simple global point of entry is what we're looking for and maybe one more thing about the three persons it's a connection through heart so it's not it can't be about violence you know it's a movement of heart to move movement of love it's a movement of action actionist but really going through how we can shift things in a smooth way it's not about going to revolution it's really about going to evolution. Yeah and then did you know this is why during the training program we the universe provided us with the the possibility of partnering with Bruce and BC from massive change network because then our ambition was always was never to create separation it was always to you know use the tools that human resonate with at this point. And so the the the the campaigning the the all those different campaigns that people are drawn to use very specific tools exactly like that curve you were talking about that that actually work why not use that to expand you know consciousness and good living and I think we're already for that and and could be excited to try it for change and and see how it works well. Absolutely beautiful yeah so exciting look already my personal experience having connected with several of the other extraordinary leaders within the Lusiel ecosystem has me thinking about Sarah are out and John Rogers and Saraya up solid right and we've podcasted already with Sarah and with John. As of this recording and plan to with Saraya quite soon and of course you know Saraya is doing extraordinary work having a background coming from Afghanistan and studying the role of charismatic leadership that is grounded in something other than love and joy and wisdom right and and how that can be so destructive in the world that that particular force and conversely how that can be so beautiful and creative when that is rooted in something like love joy wisdom peace and yeah of course John with his background having worked at the Pentagon and now doing systemic risk work in a variety of domains ranging from technology and cyber and AI and climate to things like terrorism and his book the renaissance campaign is extraordinary I've already recommended that to so many folks and you know the work that Sarah is doing in Uganda with girls and young women in particular as well as boys and young men helping I love your recent use of the word fabric it made me think of Sarah because she's helping give them skills for entrepreneurial activities making beautiful clothes and footwear and other things for the community well empowering themselves to avoid some of the very very serious and sad and tragic risks and pitfalls that a lot of folks otherwise in her community fall prey to and wow this is a growing well work of fabric of folks from all kinds of backgrounds and walks of life and sociopaths socio economic status coming together and collaborating at the heart of this sense of stewardship responsibility reciprocity I mean it's it's absolutely amazing to feel connected to this and to be a part of this. Thank you very much. We really think that's a place for everyone and we are all together creating new norms and those new norms can't come from any one person at least it's our experience it's the gathering of experience listening to each other allows the new norms to to bloom and maybe the new norm is not the same as in the world it has to be unscalable but as well adaptable so how can we find a way for the sense of global unification to be part of the journey of everyone and for everyone to create this journey as well it can be I'm following someone it's I'm creating my my life Yeah and I think the magic in all of that we see is like we told you when we started the foundation to people thought we were crazy and I'm absolutely mad. Yeah, still sometimes. And you know the old challenge where I that this year is our seventh year and you know we've you've seen that documentary the smallest or the biggest little farm or I can't remember the title but it's all around how yeah seven years that's what's needed for an ecosystem to actually regenerate itself and and then thrive completely balanced without the the help of anyone. We're right at our seventh year and it we've gone through the same challenges as these this couple that is trying to you know set up a farm and those challenges were all about the wording as well how do you how do you make it so that people as serious as the people that are in the community because we're talking about the training program but the alumni of the training program constitutes the same. It's a community that is absolutely amazing and and you know track and seeing today that that quality of participants is actually attracted to the training program follows it and takes benefit of it to create impact is such a blessing when deep gratitude to the participants and the members of the holistic visions community. Because they're there the you know the the arms and and the legs of the whole thing. Yeah, it's absolutely beautiful. Let me remind our audience. This is the why on earth community podcast.

And yeah, Olivia and Sophie when we do the behind the scenes segment of course we're going to take a little deeper dive and I have some special questions for you then in there but we'll hold that till a bit later. I wanted to come back and ask about the 12 the film can you tell us a bit about I know we've already mentioned it but just a bit more about the the profound wisdom in this film and what it was like putting that together I can only imagine you're going out to some elders in various parts of the world in the area. So every time we arrive to a country in front of one of these elders first of all it was a huge gratitude to this place to this land and always a surprise to meet simplicity. And the respect and the sense of gratitude from both sides because it was always like so we're waiting for us some of them even told us we knew from generations that at some point you are going to come and we're waiting for you like we were late and we're not obviously. And so it was really about asking them to connect to what they knew already so when we were telling them this can see this happening we felt that you were part of it for them it was most of them a direct yes for two of them it was we need to consult spirits and we need three in a size. So we had to come back to you but is there a first appreciation already and one of them needed kind of six months to tell us yes and it was. A year actually enough for you master at home I don't know our master we is the first one we asked for and when we asked again nine months after I was oh what are you talking again about. And so he was what did you learn on your journey and at that point it was it's a yes but it was always about the council it was not necessarily about the film the film came after. And the film was and it was our token of appreciation to them it was for them to have the speech that why during the 12 there's none of us it's only them it's only what they want to share to the world. And and as a quadrictor with Lucy. And the whole process of the film was Lucy was on every trip usually she stayed afterwards and she stayed a bit with the with the others. And as I mean like Sophia saying we could have done a completely different film we could have done a film about the process itself which was we don't know who to find so okay let's all you know search for guidance and try to let's take a map and see in which country in in guidance and then okay so there in this country in guidance is it a man or is there. And then we could call that a woman okay so it's a woman in this country who do we know that we could call that knows someone and then calling people you know thinking that we're crazy you're looking for a woman in my entire country which could be a spiritual leader but will not be someone famous because that's not their role okay no I don't. And then they would say okay well I don't and then they would call us back three weeks afterwards like the craziest thing happened I was in a lunch and I don't know why I talked about your thing and this guy knows someone so here's his number and so on and so on and all the the elders were found like that and when we went when we arrived on site usually we couldn't meet the master right away there was always some kind of a story. Challenge something happening test for our group on in terms of coherence so yeah and resonance like here you know where we're teaching in a training program and it was only when we had reached the point that really we were in sync vibrationally that then the elder would actually appear or that we would get a phone call saying okay you can meet so it was a whole process that let us up to the the council of 12 in New York where three days ago we were in the middle of the city of New York. And so the next day prior to the council we didn't have any room at the UN and we didn't have any room to do the opening ceremony for that council so we didn't have anything apart from 35 indigenous people in a hotel and the same thing happened we went through a whole day of a process where we put everything on the table there was a lot of crying there was it you know a lot of hidden conflicts that were resolved and that day we remember that day we were at the end of the day we were in a very, very, very, very, very, very strong and we were in a very, very strong and very, very strong and we were in the same state of the world. We were at a very high level in a building and we were in the clouds the entire day and then at the end of the day when we finished the clouds broke up with the you know a ray of sunshine and then we open our computers and an organization came back to us in the meantime saying we have a room for you at the UN with with passes with the necessary passes and then in the next hour the the assemblage the club in New York. We're telling us yeah we'll give you a whole floor for free to do your opening ceremony so that's how things roll during the trips and Lucy was didn't capture all that because it was never our intention our intention was to give speech to these elders we knew we knew that they were going to do a huge ritual for humanity in the in the UN and we wanted to give them the opportunity to speak their truth. So the film is is really about that and even though you see them traveling and you see them in New York and it's a great experience to see that it's it doesn't really the how the film was conceived which was absolutely crazy and then and then yeah Lucy came back with all the rushes and and then we collaborated both of us to do the the final cut. And they gave us so much as you said and the introduction and as you said about the tests and changes because if we can or if we give tools of coherence in our training program is because we had to go through it in intense manner I mean we could have lost someone in our team during those tests it was not about being in front of a computer on a call it was really physical we had to face our side. We had to trust universe that we're on the right path and that was really I think the most the first test we had to go through at some point I was I was on a cliff barefoot with 20 meters completely of emptiness and I was thinking okay if I'm not on the right path I'm going to die. If it was it was the right path so this feeling of we go through things we we we create something we trust universe we trust the process for incomplete faith and and I mean you can't be like that all the time yeah that level of coherence I mean we and they were crazy short trips I mean like three days to go to three days to go to Botswana like a week to do Australia and Japan. I mean we didn't we didn't do any sightseeing you know really went straight to you and then had to have the conversations and and present the whole vision and then and then up we off we went for the back to London to actually find the next cell but with crazy stories I mean the master how can Japan was found because at New Year's Eve I was at a party and I was really bored. At that party and I spoke to that one girl who I spoke of what we were trying to do and she was like you know what I think I know a guy that could Japanese master that could that could help you and I came back to Sophie we we did the readings in guidance and and surely enough he's one of the the most there's no important elder in the 12 but he was he was one that was that the public the audience of the film noticed the most because he is an elder in a city you know we always talk to being connected to nature and his main teaching was how you can connect even when you're in a city you're in Japan in in Tokyo it's full of people it's compact as no nature but you are still completely rooted into your own nature. That's why maybe people really had a special appreciation for him sometimes because he it was allowing them to realize that they could leave their life into cities and still be connected. Absolutely. Beautiful. I want to give a quick shout out to Lucy you mentioned Lucy several times. Lucy Martins or Marta how do you pronounce her? Yes, yes. Marta I mean those beautiful images have all been shot by Lucy. She's a very talented filmmaker that you know that the 12 opened was a really point of entry to our work. It was the really simple way for people to understand not what we were doing but the vibration of what we were doing and feeling attracted and called to it. And then and then for Lucy I mean it created many connections with a different wisdom traditions that she still holds really dearly and and visit often yeah it. Yeah Lucy is one of the co founder as well of the of the. Well I'm speaking of the several co founders it's been so wonderful getting to know Jesse and. Spashing some of the others and if you guys wanted to give a shout out to everybody if you'd like to recognize everybody for their roles. I mean the beauty of the way we we co funded the foundation is we all had a role and sometimes your role is to be here the first day and to disappear after because it's giving the strength to the others to continue. And so some of the co funders are not. Every day in the foundation sometimes they're not really particularly in touch anymore with foundation but was important is roles are played at the very day we put that together. Yeah and we we can only you know appreciate every day the. The achievements of this team I mean very small team no and and ready to go all the way I mean this team is relentless in the sense that you know at some sometimes we're not paid for five six seven month. And and we're still going at it because so that so yes huge shout out because we're everyone is committed 1000% to to what we're trying to do and creating a better world like in many organizations around us I mean it's. You know most of the people who don't know could could think that where this is all you who and new age and not at all the all these organizations are so driven so focused and so efficient doing amazing things with so little money. And it's a challenging life really it's you need to stand in front of your choices and and stand strong at sometimes and so we have a huge respect for our team and for all organizations that are active on that global mission it's a it's a big one and it's challenging yeah but it's rewarding at the same time yes and my team first as well a lot with our team recently is a level of precision. You know the in in our culture precision is really important says discipline versus precision being details is is is the most important thing let's say and so every project to make sure that we go through all the details together that we do our best obviously nothing is perfect no one is but we all put our efforts together to create something that is as perfect as possible we are striving to perfection let's say. Yeah and then to really to me the last thing is when we started to meet people like you know three star generals that were ready to spend hours on phone calls with us to discuss about you know projects that we had and we knew that somehow the team and its vibration was sending. There was no. There was no. We're walking the talk as much as we can with the. And so I think you know without that in the team which which is not something easy to master we would have we wouldn't be where we are with the foundation right now and the part of you. And so we are all going through a huge process of in a growth and it's not easy for all of us who are on this journey it's not easy to face our shadows to recognize them and to see the eyes of others that are pure mirrors to us because you know. A team working together for eight years together every day there exact mirrors of what you are projecting the world so you can't deny you have to face you have to see you have to accept you have to integrate change it's it's a huge job and so as well for that you know for them to be here for us and we are here for them as well we are in the reciprocity process. But to make sure that we are all keeping the line as much as possible yeah and I mean just to you know be on the I want to be reassuring because I mean this the kind of challenge for people that want to go all the way you know that really hear the call and and you know the whole world doesn't need to be like that we're really advocating for something practical easy simple that just makes your life better and and the life. So the other is that without having to go through the you know the whole challenge and because there are many levels of understanding and it's you know the right timing for everyone it's it but doing it in the community strong community is essential it makes it the safe container loving container absolutely and that's what the holistic visions is really it's it was funny we were on the phone with one of our community members and and we're trying to organize more phone calls we're trying to you know solicitate is advice on the on the on and he was like yeah you know holistic visions member are the only one I actually agreed to talk on the phone without even knowing what they want to talk about because I know there's going to be equality to the conversation that I will get some something out of it and that's priceless I mean so we're just in full gratitude for that. Yeah I can relate and the test to that sentiment and why I encourage everybody to check out the Lissiel foundation on the website list Lissiel foundation dot com. If you're able to support the Lissiel foundation support the work that's being done engage with the holistic visions training and other opportunities and offerings that Olivia and Sophie and their team have put together for you and definitely watch the film the 12. There's so much you guys have created for us and also I want to be sure to mention you're doing work for children as well and you've got this program Earth Cubs can you tell us a bit about that and what you're doing there for the for the younger among us. Yes so in 2020 I think Olivia got a vision of we should create capsules of wisdom for kids and for the last three years or four years we were trying to put that in the budget we were trying to meet some people until six months ago we've been contacted by us caps and they wanted to create a training program for kids based on the training program we do with all these things. And so Olivia's mission. You know that's right now it's it's it's again it's it's how things unfold and and that huge convergence at the same time the training program for adults or young adults is getting more and more traction the opportunity to actually come with primordial wisdom to children. And that are you know between three and 11 supported by Earth Cubs which is a great and awesome brilliant platform that not only distributes the content for free in schools but actually create the the content for teachers for them to create workshops with their with their students within classes there. In more than six thousand schools they're touching more than one point two million children at the moment and they're growing their audience is growing so fast that they're they're being so generous with what they're offering that the it's like a big wave and we get to we we have the opportunity to serve it. And to use also that leverage to get to the 3% you know and and and two families through the the kids and it's an effort that is ready to be produced but we're we haven't found the defiance yet and when we started that project about five months ago we started talking about it and what I got that's absolutely brilliant you're doing a 12 chapter mini series for kids around you know really pragmatic stuff around what they can do how they can interact at their age with primordial wisdom it's going to be so easy to find you know funds for that and it's not because you know the the situation is what it is it's it's hard to fund projects like these so any help around that is absolutely appreciated because you know all of our missions have really we've we had to set up everything from the ground up and it was a considerable amount of challenge and work to actually get this is the one that is actually it it's ready to you know it's ready to go it's and it's and it's not going to be incremental like 100 kids and then 2000 no it's straight away you know several hundreds of thousands of them and so we're really you know we're really putting the intentions that we're going to find those funds and and hopefully through the the the selling of the art that we have behind this but with the support of you know anyone that knows about grants about you know even individuals that want to support education and that kind of media but if you want to check out earth cups on on on their website they're doing absolutely incredible stuff and we're really proud and excited to have the opportunity to do something with them we need a we need a little support to activate the project but then in three months it's ready yes you can find information on our website as well on the shell foundation that comes as a full page and collaboration with those cups and if you want to support the the project as a you can donate on that page as well wonderful fabulous just a quick question out of curiosity so many schools so many kids and students is that primarily in Europe North America world wide elsewhere worldwide it's worldwide and first it was only in English and now it's getting translated it's going to be in French for sure but as well as Spanish so it's growing so it's a network is growing yeah they're looking at all sorts of different partners even in in you know multimedia companies that want to use their content on their different channels so it might be very their objective is is to reach one billion by 2030 and and and they're on it I mean so it could be you know the by the time we actually finish producing that programming it could be three million kids it's one point two for the moment for the moment but it's super exciting yes we really would like for the kids to realize that they have something to do they don't need to identify themselves only to what social media is providing them with that they have they have purity within them they have a lot of ideas they are creative they have a primal wisdom within them to to be awakened they there's a leaders of tomorrow so it would be fantastic to make sure that they are rooted in a sense of truth and not necessarily in the in the artificial world that we can live in for sometimes now for now yeah it's how how can we reconnect our children to to the world the real world and and and and the those values and principles that actually matter to thrive as a collective organism humans you know animals plants rocks this is all a beautiful creation that actually works wonderfully when you know one species is not going crazy yeah yeah connecting with the the AI right the authentic intelligence oh my god you know and I'm excited to explore ways we might be able to collaborate with you all around the earth cubs stuff in particular with our children's book series celebrating soil celebrating water celebrating honeybees and so on maybe we can chat about that for a quick minute in our behind the scenes segment and I am certainly going to ask you a bit more about the artwork behind you in our behind the scenes segment and just want to mention once more that our ambassador network have exclusive access to behind the scenes segments to videos from various conferences and symposia as well as the recordings of our monthly meetups from with folks from all around the world who are in our ambassador network and so if you're not yet in the ambassador network and you'd like to just go to wider thawdord and click on the becoming ambassador page and once again uh lissielfoundation.com to connect with uh Sophie and Olivia and the team and uh yeah maybe to wrap up our podcast today I will ask you to tell us just a little bit about the amazing artwork uh hanging behind you and for our video audience uh they're enjoying this beautiful backdrop very colorful very intriguing and as I understand it um this is a collection of original art that has something to do with christies and something to do with a special uh auction or sale to support the lissiel foundation is our aid yes so one of our co-founder Jesse had a mission of creating exhibitions and the first time she made it was uh uh uh we's um philips and we had a fantastic exhibition in 2018 and three pieces of art uh remained after that uh sadly and after that we had the christies exhibition in 2020 and we were meant to have the auction on the 6th of April and obviously the 6th of April the world was stopped by covid so there were no auction possible despite the fact that we had 300 people at our um first day in New York so we we thought it was going to be fantastic and tremendous didn't happen and since then the art was in the christies warehouse uh it's really kindly holds us the art and uh now we are putting them back just for 12 days yeah we realized the very first of all it it really is a part of the magic uh like usual as usual sorry because none of us had any experience in the into you know throwing exhibition in auctions when we started the foundation and this happened the first one was thrown like a year after we opened the foundation and and throwing auctions in support of a charity was not uh absolutely not our universe the way it was all the way it all unfolded to actually happen to partner with philips and then with christies on a second edition and having like 80 artists chip in give their uh their beautiful art usually unique pieces for cause that at the time wasn't so well defined and not as well as today it's just absolutely pure magic and uh and so that's the story behind it and and on catalog we realized that you know it doesn't give justice to the the pieces and so we were since they were in a warehouse for a while we wanted to give them some air and and enable people to come and see them uh uh there was them to find a home and for them to eventually find a home the funny thing though is that you can see them on our website as well and you can even you know click a bite button if you want to participate to the bidding uh which ends before the 30th of march uh if i'm uh wrong yeah yeah okay interesting well we'll see when this discussion publishes uh we have so true uh and but the fascinating thing that we then truly realize or maybe we had forgotten is the story of each of these uh pieces they come with a with this with a spiritual story absolutely all of them um and really really exciting really amazing stuff and we in the training program we're saying that we need to create a to work as an exes you know is uh technology art and here art is really a real technology of not only traveling but getting access to to ideas to other worlds to also understand things when i mean it's it's kind of a an honor to be surrounded by these arts right now it's just you know it's we've put that together last week and since then we're like oh it's it's you know lifting the vibration even more in our face because it's magic and art is just impressive art is sacred yes sacred is a i-vibration so shout out to all the artists all the people who are helping us supporting us on the on the journey and particularly you Aaron and your beautiful wine as community thank you yes well i have to i have to give a shout out to our court group of ambassadors who have launched our artist guild uh and it's it's so magical to be able to gather with creative specifically working in service to nature and humanity and i have to ask because i know one of our uh digital development team is going to wonder this are you are you also offering uh NFTs digital assets related to the artwork we should we have all uh yeah we are all here to learn yeah i think just he just went into that rabbit hole uh about uh a year ago she went really deep trying to create an NFT with an amazing artist that didn't pan out wasn't the right time maybe but yeah of course super open to learning more about it because we don't have the expertise that's for sure well i know i just got to talk to a dear friend who goes by echo um can can be helpful with that if you guys are interested and uh yeah i'm i'm i'm i'm really excited we can channel a little more about that in the uh behind the scene segment coming right up um and just to wrap up the podcast conversation uh i want to thank you both sofi and libya for offering uh to our world something so precious so sacred so potent uh that i've personally been able to experience and continue to experience and uh really encourage folks to uh connect with licea l foundation and engage and and figure out a way to get involved uh as soon as possible uh time is of the essence and as we like to say uh slow a smooth smooth as fast there's no stress but i encourage folks to connect and get involved um expeditiously and before we sign off i just i want to invite each of you uh to share anything additional that you'd like uh with our audience and again sofi and libya thank you thank you so much from my heart um the first thing i'd like to share with you uh is that if you want to if you know your listeners want to know more about the training program itself they can check everything on website under uh the holistic vision training program um all the information is in there but the the journey is is really going from the eye to the we in a bit exactly like you said in a very detailed and and and and driven way uh from individual clearing to then you know putting yourself in service of the group and then creating coherence and then designing life-centered uh principle-based ideas and projects everything's on the website and the second thing is uh of course reciprocating that deep gratitude that that you just expressed um to you to every actionist every uh every person that is a you know aligned feeling the alignment and uh faithfully working to expand that vision i also want to i'm very grateful for the uh the universe itself or source or but whatever you want to call it because we're very conscious that um we're just instruments uh we're just conduits it's not really about us uh about you know us personally and we were we were also told that with the elders when they were telling us we've been waiting for you well you know some white people it didn't matter if it was us or anyone else the what matter was the mission to go to the UN and that's the kind of uh you know mindset we're in um so yeah but i invite everyone that wants to help change the world's mindset uh in a pragmatic and practical way to you know uh join us and then we're all about collaboration we can't do this alone and i'm going yes to ask everyone who feels cold to these three-person movement to come to us and see how we can create that together and uh i would like to
