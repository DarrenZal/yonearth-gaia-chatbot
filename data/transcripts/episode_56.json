Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast Series.\n\nToday I’m so excited that we have visiting with us Brian Czech, hi Brian.\n\nWelcome to the programs, Eric.\n\nBrian is an ecological economist and is the executive director of the Center for the\n\nAdvancement of the Steady State Economy, also known as Cassie.\n\nBrian spent nearly 20 years at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service headquarters\n\nbefore resigning in 2017 to run Cassie.\n\nHis books include Supply Shock, Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train, and the Endangered\n\nSpecies Act, History, Conservation Biology, and Public Policy.\n\nBrian has a PhD from the University of Arizona and is a leading figure in ecological economics.\n\nI would like to also note that he was the first conservation biologist ever hired by the\n\nUS Fish and Wildlife Service and that Cassie has been awarded the Eco-Champion Award\n\nby public employees for environmental responsibility known as peer for their work in the arena\n\nof limits to growth and ecological carrying capacity and integrity YonEarth.\n\nAnd Brian, I’m so thrilled we have the opportunity to speak together today and I think it’s\n\njust hilarious.\n\nHere we are at a park.\n\nWe’re having to meet up in Aspen.\n\nWe’re both traveling through the High Mountains of Colorado.\n\nIt’s been raining for, I don’t know, 20-25 minutes or something and we are under a beautiful\n\nblue spruce which has more or less shielded all the rain from us so here we are.\n\nAnd welcome Brian and thank you for taking the time to visit with us.\n\nThank you.\n\nThanks.\n\nSo why don’t you kick us off framing the conversation, what is all this about?\n\nWhat is the issue when we’re talking about a steady state economy versus a perpetually\n\ngrowing economy?\n\nWell, I think it always helps to remind people what economic growth is.\n\nIt’s simply increasing production and consumption of goods and services in the aggregate.\n\nAnd so that means growing human population and or per capita production and consumption\n\nand it’s measured with GDP.\n\nAnd that’s an acronym that stands for gross domestic product.\n\nAnd we sometimes call it gross domestic problem because it’s beginning to cause more problems\n\nthan it solves.\n\nOur of course tremendous benefits to economic production but there are at this stage in human\n\nhistory tremendous impacts and any environmental impact it’s not just a tree hugger issue.\n\nThe environment is the foundation of the economy.\n\nSo there’s a we say that there is a fundamental conflict, fundamental because it can’t be gotten\n\nout of with just technological progress, for example, a fundamental a fundamental conflict\n\nbetween economic growth and four things, four categories of things, environmental protection,\n\neconomic sustainability, national security and international stability.\n\nMore or less in that order.\n\nAlthough you might say well it’s the international stability that comes before the national\n\nsecurity because international instability is such a great threat as well to national security.\n\nIt’s so interesting you know I have been struck working in and around the field of economics\n\nas it relates to environmental sustainability and that it has been the militaries by and\n\nlarge the intelligence community and the reinsurance industries who were most advanced in understanding\n\nsome of these major systemic risks that we have been facing out you know several decades\n\ncreeping a bit closer now and that these issues of international stability, national security\n\nare so intimately linked with environmental protection and economic sustainability from\n\na policy standpoint.\n\nIt seems golly at some of our I don’t want to use the term knucklehead on a recording\n\nlike this but some of our friends and colleagues in Congress and inside DC could do a little\n\nbetter in understanding some of these connections and they’re really is we live in a giant ecology\n\nplanet earth it’s a contained and limited system a beautiful one and we share it with all\n\nour other human brothers and sisters all around the planet.\n\nSo I just am so struck that getting into a conversation around economics and the assumptions\n\nthat we’re working within our culture when it comes to economics there’s a lot there\n\nthat needs to be looked at and examined for sure and the part about limits to growth I\n\nmean that shouldn’t be that it’s not rocket science that you can’t have a perpetually growing\n\neconomy I mean what are we going to have a trillion quadrillion gazillion GDP when we think\n\nin these ridiculous terms that’s when we usually start to get some buy and even from\n\nconventional economists that well yeah sure they’re probably our limits to growth but they’re\n\nso far out there that why you know why should we even bother thinking about that now but that’s\n\nit that’s a whole different discussion all of a sudden then whether or not there is a limit\n\nto economical once we all agree that yeah of course you can’t not you can’t have a perpetually\n\ngrowing economy then the question is well where should we stop that growth of the economy when\n\nwhen is it starting to cause more problems than it solves and a lot of us you know that that love\n\nwide open spaces and big trees and wildlife and solitude you know we think it’s already post-optimal\n\nthat the economy is already too big for optimum conditions on the earth and I think there’s a lot\n\nof people are starting to agree with this yeah it’s not just the natural world now it’s creeping\n\ninto our economies it’s harder and harder to maintain this level of economic activity in the US\n\nand on the globe and and it is very yeah tightly connected with the international stability and\n\nand national security not only from the pressures caused by international instability but the need\n\nfor economic sustainability to maintain for example a military right much less a healthy society\n\nso I’m struck that we’ll be on this episode talking a bit about different aspects of the\n\neconomics and I forget who said it but somebody called economics the dismal science right I know\n\nfor sure it’s not every one of our favorite subjects but nonetheless I think it really is important\n\nfor us as citizens as voters as participants in this momentous time in the human story that we\n\nhave some working understanding of some of these economic principles and with that in mind I’m hoping\n\nyou know we’re talking about some debates that have been going on for decades even even a couple\n\ncenturies going back to the late 1800s the enlightenment period we had the Scottish enlightenment\n\nmost famous among them being probably Adam Smith who wrote Wealth of Nations published 1776\n\nand across the water there we had the French physiocrats very focused on the natural foundation\n\nof economic production and activity and I was hoping you could walk through when we’re talking\n\nabout primary secondary tertiary all these these steps and kind of what’s going on in that broader\n\neconomic picture just walk us through how that how we understand that to be working it would be\n\nhelpful I’m sure for many in our audience yeah well in in ecological economics we call that the\n\ntrophic structure of the economy so if we start with the economy of nature yeah which both\n\nFrancois Canay and the physiocrats and Adam Smith had a pretty good grasp you know they were\n\nrenaissance man they understood the the bigger picture of the world they knew a lot about agricultural\n\nproduction and how the natural world worked and how that linked into economic activity yeah so\n\nin the economy of nature you know you have the at the base of that the producers the plants\n\nyeah called producers because they produce their own food via the process of photosynthesis yeah\n\nand then what each the plants those are primary consumers and then what consumes the primary\n\nconsumers are secondary consumers like predators so that’s the that’s the very basics of the\n\nstructure of the economy of nature yeah and you know and there are service providers too like\n\ndecomposers and scavengers and pollinators so humans come along evolve and were created\n\nthey’re there now and and they’re part of this economy of nature and they’re at the pinnacle\n\nof this trophic structure for one thing yeah they can eat anything else out there that’s edible\n\num and they also have to follow the same basic rules of the game they have their they have a\n\ntrophic structure in their economy they’re like a subset of that broader uh economy of nature\n\nand if you take this subset out and analyze it it has its trophic structure so it starts with the\n\nagricultural and extracted sectors those are the producers that would be like forests,\n\ntrees, fishing, mining these kinds of yeah taking from earth and earth’s productivity directly\n\nexactly okay directly and then uh and then built upon that you have the the manufacturing sectors\n\nand those are the basic trophic levels the heavy manufacturing you know like iron ore refining\n\nall the way up to the lightest sectors like computer chip manufacturing yeah folks making cell phones\n\nand yeah all that kind of business mm-hmm and mix all throughout that our service sectors just\n\nlike in the economy of nature and so and that it’s actually a good way to view the fundamental\n\nconflict between economic growth and environmental protection because as that part of the economy\n\nof nature continues to expand it’s like a like a trophic compression of all the other species below\n\nin that the broader economy of nature so when you look at the list of um species that are endangered\n\nthis burgeoning list of threatened and endangered species and you look at the causes of their\n\nendangerment it’s like a who’s who of the American economy right just this and that sector one after\n\nanother that is what’s pushed that’s what uh is liquidating the habitats that species require to\n\nto make a living in and uh and and same thing with animal and plant species being squeezed out\n\nby that growth of the human economy yeah well we’re certainly uh living in precarious times and uh\n\nI just heard recently that at the time approximately of I want to say uh president\n\nFranklin Roosevelt was it or maybe as Teddy Roosevelt there were about two billion people on the\n\nplanet and now just over a hundred years or about a hundred years later we have about seven and a\n\nhalf billion people on the planet and you know many of my friends working in the realm of\n\nof social justice as it relates especially to the environmental issues that were concerned with\n\num point out that some of the population discussion or debate is very loaded with\n\nsocial justice issues and really ethical issues and issues that require us to look at\n\nour human decency and matters of dignity and matters of the heart if you will\n\nbut that that all aside for just a moment just looking purely at the numbers of growing from\n\nsomething like two billion to almost four times as much within just a few generations\n\nthat’s obviously a pattern you don’t want to uh to see perpetuating or or continuing for too\n\nmany more generations in this situation it should be obvious shouldn’t it yeah\n\nIndia India alone has a billion people yeah and and people that are at the that do not consume\n\nas wastefully in a per capita basis as they do in the US for example right and nevertheless you\n\ncan already see the signs of resource shortage the much of Tamil Nadu in southern India is without water\n\nvery clear it’s a perilous existence uh in cities like Chennai huge cities in southern India and\n\nthere’s no end in sight that the it’s not only climate change it’s the use of the water resources\n\nthere yep and water is the lifeblood of the economy i mean some people might say it’s oil\n\nwell okay you know it uh lifeblood uh energy the calories required one’s oil one’s water they’re\n\nboth required for this level of economic activity you know 82 trillion dollar global economy right now\n\nand uh so the economy once again going back to the earliest minutes of this it’s it’s population times\n\nper capita production and consumption yep either one’s too high gets to be too much\n\nwith the planet and the future economy yeah i just i have to point out or i know a few of my friends will\n\ngive me a hard time afterward with respect to the water and the oil uh peace so many folks now are\n\nworking on solutions to transition from oil clearly there are a whole number of reasons why\n\nthat’s worthwhile and thankfully underway water on the other hand there’s no substitute for water\n\nwater is life our bodies obviously are composed of it 70% are better uh same as the surface of the\n\nplanet itself uh interestingly and so clearly when we’re when we’re now confronted with situations\n\naround the planet where more and more of us do not have access to water um that that ought to be\n\non its face enough for us to be thinking about these economic issues uh hands down absolutely and\n\num it’s i think that although it seems like economic growth is so in scanced as you know the primary\n\npolicy goal around the world it’s it you can see the the cracks in that firmament if you will\n\nin a lot of countries now in a lot of parts of the world uh Bhutan moving to the pursuit of\n\ngross national happiness just because they see all the unhappiness around the world associated with\n\npulling out all the stops for GDP growth right um you know and even before that at the\n\nThailand’s idea of the sufficiency economy rather than you know more and more every year\n\nyeah um their precedence for this and uh it’s a logical way to go it’s the uh uh the the ethical way\n\nto go and it’s the diplomatic way to go i mean when we call for a steady state economy in the US\n\nuh obviously that’s not sufficient for global sustainability we so we have a vision for\n\nsteady statesmanship we like to call it an international diplomacy we have to figure out uh\n\nwhere are the biggest problems in terms of the per capita consumption where is the most\n\nwasteful consumption and and where our populations burgeoning so rapidly that the rest of the world\n\ncan absorb that those rates of immigration yeah both of these things have to really be wrestled\n\nseriously in international diplomacy yeah uh growth is not the answer growth right\n\nis just compounding both of those two problems yes yes absolutely hey you know i love uh the\n\ndiscussion around the gross national happiness uh work that’s being done in Bhutan and i\n\nimagine some of our audience may not be familiar is that something you can tell us a little more\n\na little more yeah um so the there was Bhutan was a kingdom yeah as little as seven years ago maybe\n\nand the king of Bhutan um did look around and had become familiar with some of the uh\n\nprinciples of ecological economics i think he was familiarized partially through uh the\n\nconvention on biological diversity that heads of state attended and um and you know and there’s\n\nsort of a a bit of a common sense out there now around the world that there’s serious environmental\n\nproblems and that is such a spectacularly beautiful country and the people from Bhutan are\n\nproud of that if you you know meet the people from there they are happy how couldn’t you be in\n\nin such a spectacular place and and so they want to keep it that way they look out at what they have\n\nand they don’t want that to change dramatically they don’t want bulldozers coming in and skyscrapers\n\nmessing up messing that up so so he uh uh said to the people you know GDP is not what we’re after\n\nwe’re after gross national happiness and and concurrently with that as you know he moved that\n\ngovernment into a ministerial government so that’s kind of a very nice uh sequence of events\n\nboth what we might call steady statesmanship corresponding with a more democratic form of government\n\nabsolutely beautiful absolutely beautiful i just want to make a quick note um for it slips my mind\n\nand uh that reminds me of uh something we were discussing earlier uh which is often the\n\nthe activities we can engage in on a day-to-day basis that are most conducive to our health our well-being\n\nour high quality of life our activities where we’re not buying and consuming here here we are\n\nunder a blue spruce it’s been raining a while we’ve been standing here a while it’s been\n\nabsolutely delightful we’re we’re getting so much benefit in the fresh air and uh i wish you\n\nwas throwing off a little more heat a little more heat but uh you know it has sheltered that’s\n\nhere here we are and we’re not we’re not spending money to be right here yeah good point because money\n\noriginates you know with that agricultural and extractive activity at the base um that goes\n\nback to that the trophic structure of the economy and when it comes to monetary matters we we\n\ncall that uh well we call it the trophic theory of money because money does originate via the\n\nagricultural surplus especially that frees the hands for the division of labor into all these\n\ndifferent activities economic activities but uh you know a lot of the pleasures of life like\n\nyou know the folks that just came around walking the dog with the little grandkids and stuff that\n\ndidn’t cost anything and uh and it’s not nobody’s paying for that or extracting resources uh in any\n\nyou know they obviously somebody had to make a living to feed the family yeah there’s the base\n\nlevel nobody’s saying don’t have any economic activity to matter how much yeah the appropriate levels\n\nyeah well i’m really struck uh about the fact that you’re doing a whole lot of work at the policy\n\nlevel uh working with lawmakers etc and and what i want to make sure we get to that in a couple\n\nminutes okay but of course with the why on earth community we also uh in addition to our civic\n\nwork and uh conversations with policy makers etc we are also very focused on what can we do in our\n\nday-to-day lives uh folks from all sorts of backgrounds and one of the things you mentioned earlier\n\nto me before we started the recording that uh really really stuck is your emphasis on spending less\n\nsimply spending less certainly uh when we were just talking about how uh more money the supply\n\nof money and the flow of money money supplies like the m zero the m one the the liquid types of\n\nmoney supplies and flows of money like GDP these are outstanding indicators of environmental impact\n\nright at this point in history GDP is probably a better indicator of environmental impact than it\n\nis with any kind of well-being and so yeah spending less that that entails a little less of that\n\neconomic activity you know why uh by purchase something that’s already provided by nature we\n\ndidn’t have to go out by a tent that would have required more surplus at that economic base\n\nthere’s already a tree here we can stand under um there’s examples just one after another\n\nin the course of uh of a day of a human life um yeah it’s this this one will seem maybe kind of\n\ncorny but you when you wash your hands you don’t necessarily have to pull out a paper towel or run\n\nsome electric yeah dry area you know think about the uh 300 some million people in the country that\n\nare doing that several times a day that stuff really adds up it really does it absolutely does\n\nyeah paper cups straws off yeah all of that by what well you’re getting me rolling now sorry\n\nbut i i have to say it i can’t stand those hummers uh you know and thank goodness the the\n\nhummer demand seems to have abated but for a while hummers were all the rage and you know during\n\nthe the uh golf wars besides what a horrible symbolism that was and what a uh awful example\n\nof conspicuous consumption that is not only unsustainable but um you know way you know way\n\nit alone was a threat to national security because it makes americans or whichever country’s\n\nyou know behaving like that makes us look bad it really looks like greedy pigs truly and then\n\nyou know and then we want to shut down the borders from people that have the orders of magnitude\n\nless those two things combined uh look really bad right we’re not looking like uh good citizens\n\nin the neighborhood exactly in this way yeah yep you know it reminds me too you know when we’re\n\ntaking a walk say or just having a nice chat in the park with somebody for a couple hours\n\nwe’re not contributing to GDP at that point however if in a scenario say i was walking down the street\n\ni got hit by a car an ambulance had to come get me take me to a hospital meanwhile i got news\n\nperhaps i was about to get a divorce or something i’m not actually married but uh you know and\n\nhave to get some lawyers in the mix at this that and the other you know i could have all of these\n\nreally terrible things happening to me but guess what those are all positive contributors to GDP\n\nwell good thing you didn’t get hit by a hummer it oh yeah it’d be even worse just the worst of all\n\nworlds but i think it just illustrates that for for a lot of us uh maybe who we haven’t thought about\n\nthis quite as much GDP is not at all an indicator as to quality of life as to uh how well things are\n\ngoing right you know to to be fair to conventional economics and conventional economists um in\n\ncountries with truly widespread poverty yes you know then GDP per capita is a useful metric\n\nright but you know you can’t get carried away it’s not the only metric because of the examples\n\nlike the ones you just mentioned but uh certainly in a country where the vast majority is reasonably\n\nwell fed and sheltered and far beyond that frankly uh then the GDP per capita is causing\n\njust as many problems as it’s solving and human health and uh social social life and uh political\n\nlife it’s um that’s why you know way back in the 1860s John Stuart Mill probably very familiar\n\nwith it was calling already for what he called a stationary state which had nothing to do with a\n\nstagnating economy or society you know in a steady state economy there’s plenty of room for\n\ntechnological replacement for consumer preferences to shift uh for all kinds of economic dynamism\n\ndynamic changes in the economy it’s just the size of that thing that is what matters uh in terms of\n\nsustainability that’s what matters the most and so John Stuart Mill recognized that way back in\n\nthe 1860s in England and said you know why don’t we focus more on quality of life outside of\n\nthis economic activity you know political life and civil civil life and civil rights and reforms\n\nand um you know improving uh child’s education uh and all the other things that oftentimes are\n\nactually competed for uh by you know regular economic activities that go into that are included\n\nin GDP calculations yeah yeah absolutely absolutely I would love if we could share a little bit about\n\nthe Cassie position on economic growth and I want to mention that folks if you’d like to learn more\n\nand you can actually there’s a great really quick video at steadystate.org and on there you can\n\nalso check out and if you would like to you can become a signer of the Cassie position on economic\n\ngrowth by the way there are already 14,000 signatures signatories and 215 organizations as well have\n\nendorsed this so I you can see here it’s a kind of a full page it’s which is a summary of something\n\nthat’s fairly complex but I thought it might be nice to read a few of the highlights if that sounds\n\ngood Brian yeah and uh you want you want me to go forward or you want to do it okay so it says\n\nwhereas economic growth as defined in standard economics textbooks is an increase in the\n\nproduction and consumption of goods and services based upon established principles of physics and\n\necology there is a limit to economic growth therefore we take the position that there is a fundamental\n\nconflict between economic growth and environmental protection for example biodiversity conservation\n\nclean air and water atmospheric stability and a steady state economy that is an economy with a\n\nrelatively stable mildly fluctuating production of population and per capita consumption is a\n\nviable alternative to a growing economy and has become a more appropriate goal in large wealthy\n\neconomies and for many nations with widespread poverty increasing per capita consumption or\n\nalternatively more equitable distributions of wealth remains an appropriate goal so what I\n\nlove about this framework is that it is it’s speaking to and encompassing a lot of complexity\n\nbut specifically is calling out that there there are different appropriate courses for the\n\nwealthy more developed nations versus the poorest economies around the world and I really\n\nappreciate that it recognizes that subtlety yeah we had to or just it makes ethical sense\n\nand it makes political sense frankly yeah yeah I guess you showed that to them but you know the\n\nCassie position has 16 sentences and so Aaron just read like five that kind of summarized this\n\nthing that’s already a summary of yeah see a complex issue yep so so you two can\n\nsign on to this along with some very notable thought leaders like E.O. Wilson, Jane Goodall,\n\nVandana Shiva, David Suzuki, Chris Matthews, right so some folks who have also given this a whole\n\nlot of thought have signed on and are considering this a very worthwhile cause\n\nso Brian I thought it would be good to also discuss you know what when we’re talking with our\n\ncongresspeople lawmakers etc what are what are some of the key points and in what\n\nways do we best frame this discussion for them well right now we have a president Trump\n\nwho is obsessed with GEP girls and so if you’re a Democrat and you’re going to visit you know\n\na Democratic representative or senator why not tell them look Trump’s got this argument that he’s\n\nsuch a success because that GDP growth rate is so high but look at all the stops he’s pulling out\n\nfor that he’s trashing the environmental regulations of the country are standing in international\n\ndiplomacy he’s pulling us out of international of crucial international agreements you know he’s\n\nall over with the tariffs so what we what and when I say we I’m an independent personally politically\n\nbecause because both parties are still so pro-growth but what a what a Democrat can do is like we\n\ndid with Cory Booker we went into Cory Booker’s office met with staff and said you know\n\ngiven Trump’s argument why not take some baby steps away from condoning GDP growth okay\n\nthis at least baby steps and so you may have heard Cory Booker has said things lately like\n\nGDP doesn’t speak to my constituents that’s a baby step and that’s key because once there is one\n\nby one politician on the hill there will be other you know leak-frogging steps by other politicians\n\non the hill especially with a prominent one you know a presidential candidate like that so that’s\n\none thing we suggest ask your representative to take some baby steps you know rhetorical baby steps\n\nto get the idea out there in the public and in the polity with all the policy makers that GDP\n\nis in everything and then it won’t take long to point out that it really is a gross domestic\n\nproblem as well as its gross domestic product and and the the concept that there is such a thing as\n\npost optimal growth growth that’s causing more harm than good that will that will start to percolate\n\nand that’ll that’s steady statesmanship you know if this is growth that’s unsustainable\n\nwell that would be unsustainable degrowth what’s the sustainable alternative it’s this thing in\n\nbetween that’s the steady state economy it’s a middle path I like that yeah the middle path\n\nand what about those of us who would be speaking with Republican members of congress what\n\nadvice do you have on that on that side well so we feel at Cassie that we have a latent\n\nconnection with rural communities in particular farmers and hunters and fishermen they’re the\n\nfirst ones that see the the detriment of an overgrown economy the green spaces gone the taxes\n\nare getting so intense it’s hard to maintain a farm anymore or a ranch you know the hunting grounds\n\naren’t there anymore every place is posted so we think that some of our most natural allies are\n\nactually Republicans you know they call themselves conservatives yeah well we say we’re the true\n\nconservative you know conservation is a steady state economy it’s like in the tradition of\n\nTeddy Roosevelt yeah in the tradition of TR that’s right yeah you know Teddy Roosevelt set aside all\n\nof these national wildlife refugees and national forests and to and what those are are you know\n\nyou think of a national wildlife refuge what’s it a refuge from it’s a refuge from the economy\n\nthat’s right you know you put those signs out and you protect that from the bulldozers and and\n\neven from from too much outdoor recreation sure you can’t have too much of any economic activity\n\nbut the main thing is you know the the economy in the aggregate all the sectors added up\n\nyeah that’s really great Brian oh go ahead please yeah please so you know that’s that’s a real\n\ngeneral thing you can tell your politician we we are we have embarked on a long term legislative\n\nproject that Cassie yeah and that’s to amend the employment act which is the central macroeconomic\n\npolicy of the United States and after the 1978 amendments it was called the full employment\n\nand balance growth act so Congress got the government not not only into economic stabilization\n\nbut into growth as a formal policy role and it’s reflected all over in fiscal and monetary\n\npolicy and trade policy too so what we have we are rewriting the employment act to what we call\n\nthe full and sustainable employment and it starts with a preamble that\n\nCongress finds and declares that there is a limit to economic growth and that economic growth\n\nis causing many profound problems in the USA and in the world and we are therefore\n\nsetting as a goal a long-term goal a sustainable steady-state economy and then the rest of the\n\nact is going to be about the programs and procedures for transitioning from a growth economy\n\nto the steady-state and nobody you know there’s not going to be any breaks that are slammed on\n\nso that overnight a steady-state economy happens there will be decades of adjustments in monetary\n\npolicy in the banking system and in fiscal policy and the tax code and in the budgets federal\n\nand state and local budgets and planning and zoning policies but certainly you know that there\n\nthere’s got to be some leadership at the federal level and meanwhile there’s a lot of opportunity\n\nat local levels so we have another campaign we’re just starting called keep our counties great\n\ncampaign I love it because if you like your kind if you like what you see when you look out there\n\nwell you want to keep it that way and that is the steady-state economy\n\nso how can we how can we get involved and support and help all this work that you’re doing\n\nwell like you said before start by visiting the website steady-state.org and sign the\n\nCassie position that’s sort of as you might imagine we’re swimming straight upstream the river\n\nof political economy big money doesn’t want us around there’s certainly not going to donate to us\n\nso the only other thing that speaks as loudly as money to the politician is signatures\n\nso these signatures really do matter and of course if you feel so compelled as to donate obviously\n\ndonations are going to help we have we’re one of the leanest nonprofits out there we only have two\n\nat this time full-time employees and two part-time and then we have a fairly robust internship\n\nprogram and volunteer program we have Cassie chapters around the world join a Cassie chapter\n\nbecome a chapter director if you you know how if you feel like you want to provide some leadership\n\nin this you know read up more on the topic we have resources at the website books and journal articles\n\nthat will provide you with the tools that you need you know to be able to talk shop on steady-state\n\neconomics what else can you do well we already talked about spending last year but I would say\n\nstart using the phrase frankly steady-state economy because there’s there’s too much\n\nlack of clarity out there right now about what the alternatives are hashtag steady-state\n\nyeah yeah I say steady-state cool I dig it so Brian
