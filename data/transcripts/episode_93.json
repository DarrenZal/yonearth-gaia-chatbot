I’m your host, Aaron William Perry and today\n\nwe’re visiting with Mike Lewis here at Zeal Opticss. Hey Mike. Hey Aaron. How are you?\n\nI’m doing great. Happy to be here or happy here. Yeah thanks. I’m really excited about\n\nthis episode and I’m a big fan of Zeal and have actually been wearing your guys sunglasses\n\nfor years now so and we’ll get into some of what you guys are doing and innovation\n\naround materials and sustainability and the ways that you’re giving back and hopefully\n\na lot of folks in our community and audience will get some Zeal products for their own\n\nuse or for gifts or what have you. Yeah that’d be great and hopefully the message and\n\nour mission and vision really resonate with them as well. Yeah I have a feeling. I should\n\ngo up here and what I know about Y on Earth. Yeah exactly. So Mike Lewis is the director\n\nof marketing at Zeal Opticss. He’s a Colorado native and has focused his career on the\n\noutdoor industry with a particular focus on sustainability. With degrees in environmental\n\nscience and journalism from the University of Colorado Boulder and an MBA in sustainability\n\nand marketing from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Mike’s goal has been to find\n\nways to showcase how brands can profitably impact and lead the environmental conversation.\n\nBefore joining Zeal Opticss in 2013 and becoming director of marketing, he served as editor\n\nin chief for trans-world business and yeah so it’s so fun for me Mike and I’m smiling\n\nbecause as we were setting up the equipment before we started recording we were talking\n\nabout the upcoming ski season and getting kind of excited for getting up there in the\n\nsnowy country and you know I love we’re right here in downtown Boulder, Colorado and this\n\nis one of the storefronts that I always enjoy walking by and popping into because of what\n\nyou guys are doing and I guess before we get into the sustainability stuff let’s just\n\ntalk real quick about the kinds of products you’re making available. Yeah for sure. So\n\nwe focus on sunglasses and goggles, ski goggles specifically and these are you know really\n\ngear for any sports in the outdoors you know especially here in places like Colorado where\n\nwe have so much sunshine, so much UV light coming through it’s essential to have a good pair of\n\nshades but you know really for adventures anywhere around the world you know this is a great\n\nway to marry our passion for outdoor sports and for sustainability in a product that everybody\n\nneeds and it uses. Yeah very cool and we’re going to at the end of the episode we’re going to do a\n\nbit of a walk around around the store and show you guys all the different products it’s really a\n\nlot to look at and it’s so beautifully laid out it really if there’s a nice aesthetic experience\n\ncoming in. Thank you. Yeah I enjoy it so and I also I want to ask you a bit about your background\n\nand what you were doing in your your studies that led to now what you’re doing professionally.\n\nYeah so growing up in Colorado my parents were huge outdoor enthusiasts then you know backpacking\n\nand you know skiing since like before I could walk really and you know over a lifetime of\n\ntraveling around the world seeing amazing places and you know seeing those change on you know a\n\ntimeline that shouldn’t be the case has you know really taken what started as an interest in nature\n\nand natural processes and you know geology and climatology and you know shifted that to a focus\n\non you know how we can use our voices how we can use you know whatever reach that we have whatever\n\nleverage we have to make an impact and get people to think and you know hopefully change the way\n\nthey operate. So you know it’s been it’s been a fun journey and you know one that’s you know\n\nconstantly changing for all of us. Yeah absolutely you know this is causing me to think about something\n\nI’ve reflected on and even written about a little bit which is the evolution of the culture here in\n\nColorado and I also as you know grew up did a lot of my grown up in the Denver area and it has\n\nbeen remarkable to see this region grow from a pretty sort of white bread kind of meat and potatoes\n\nculture into a very progressive culture leading a lot of innovations in the sustainability arena\n\nand also has a very strong and healthy ecosystem of entrepreneurship right and it’s when those\n\ntwo are coming together I think that we see a lot of exciting action it’s not to say there aren’t\n\nother hot spots around the country and around the world indeed there are but I think you know this is\n\none of the one of the special ones. Yeah a hundred percent and you have a very good point\n\nare reflecting on that and growing up Colorado is incredibly red and you’re seeing it’s\n\nskew now you know more and more blue purplish is you know they like to say is you know very nice\n\nthat at the same time it’s taken a huge influx of population which has changed a lot of the\n\nrecreation opportunities that we enjoy around here too so and there’s always trade offs in life\n\nyeah yeah it’s really true yeah yeah well it’s a good place to be I sure do love and appreciate it\n\nso I’d like to ask a bit about zeal’s history and you know how a goggles and sunglasses company\n\nis helping lead the conversation with sustainability and the materials being used in the products\n\nyeah great question so the company was actually founded in 1997 in Moab, Utah by a couple that\n\nwere professional mountain bikers and huge skiers and they wanted to start an Opticss company that\n\nlived up to you know the the rigorous you know nature of the products that they needed you know\n\nthe Opticss on the market just weren’t serving their needs they moved to Boulder a couple years\n\nafterwards just for you know better access to distribution and talent pool etc and you know they\n\nwere very focused on these sports and the technical aspects and you know the focus on sustainability\n\nwas there but not really a driving part of the business and in 2010 Maui Jim purchased the company\n\nand we’re really really looking at the technology the patents in an intellectual property that\n\nMaui that zeal Opticss had and decided to you know find some ways to you know really re-engineer it\n\nfrom a design standpoint and to refocus its niche on sustainability you know the Opticss world\n\nis so big and it’s so competitive that you know looking at the Boulder market looking at you\n\nknow the younger outdoor consumer they saw an opening for that and we had the opportunity to\n\ntake this brand and really reshape it and figure out how we can continually push you know what goes\n\ninto our products the messaging as well as what we’re doing as a brand to give back to the community\n\nin the world yeah to me is such an interesting microcosm to dig into a little bit when a company\n\nidentifies an opportunity for competitive advantage by leading the pack when it comes to sustainability\n\nattributes and qualifications but part of the hope is that leadership also means the industry is\n\ngoing to transform and do some catching up and have you already seen that kind of phenomena out\n\nthere with the other brands that maybe have more you know market reach already yeah must definitely\n\nthere’s when we started we were the only ones with our full line being made from plant-based\n\nmaterials yeah and we’ve seen a lot of other brands step into that yeah following suit as well\n\nas larger players you know launching you know smaller collections that use similar materials and\n\nyou know pushing the boundaries on what other materials exist and we’re still the only ones that\n\nhave a hundred percent of our line using that side of things but you know especially on the\n\ngoggle side we’re a very small player and there’s just very few factories on that side and so\n\ngetting the materials to a place where we can use plant-based materials requires you know other\n\nlarger players to kind of come along for the ride yeah so we have actually been actively reaching out\n\nto our competitors and you know showcasing materials that exist and how well they perform\n\nand lobbying that you know people get on board you know at the end of the day especially on the\n\nsnow side you know that’s the bleeding edge of the impact of climate change and you know if we’re\n\nnot espousing what we’re telling our you know customers then we’re doing it wrong we’re\n\ndestined to fail yeah yeah that’s a really good point well it’s been wild to watch some of the\n\nevolution in the the outdoor industry in particular you mentioned the founders of Zio coming\n\noriginally from Utah and of course there was recently a major shift with the big outdoor annual\n\nconvention moving from Utah to Colorado and I’m curious if these conversations with some of\n\nthese larger competitors are turning into opportunities for collaboration are you are you seeing a\n\ngenerally collaborative atmosphere across the industry or is it a little more silo than that it\n\ndepends as a larger industry 100 so the outdoor industry association is based here in Boulder\n\nColorado and they have a sustainability working group that is focused on you know how as an\n\nindustry as you know product specialists as marketers you know really drilled down into the\n\nvarious aspects of all of our businesses we can improve our processes how we can certify our\n\nfactories our supply chains and you know that on kind of the global scale if you will for from an\n\nindustry standpoint is is huge and you see you know very close competitors working together on\n\nthat front as far as working closely with your direct competitors you know that’s still a little\n\ntouchy at this point but we’re getting there and we all collaborate you know that every it’s a very\n\nsmall industry but very influential at this point especially in the western states and growing\n\nland globally yeah yeah well and if what I’m about to ask you know is is is is verging into the realm\n\nof proprietary and the strategic trade secrets and so on let me know but I’m very curious you know\n\nwhat is Zeal’s plan looking out over five years is the idea to get acquired and help you know to\n\ngrow further off that stronger capital you know balance sheet of a larger corporation or are\n\nyou guys anticipating continuing to grow and diversify your offerings as a as a standalone player out\n\nyeah I mean we’re very fortunate as I mentioned we were purchased by Maui Jim a few years back\n\nabout a decade now yeah and Maui Jim is the last independently held large scale Opticss company\n\nin the world I mean they are on the scale they’re they are bigger than any other one single brand\n\nhuh you know they are actively being pursued by the lexatica’s of the world but you know the\n\nowner of the brand is very focused on doing what he does and his team does very well and that\n\nis Opticss you know they make sunglasses eyeglasses and with a zeal goggles yeah very cool that\n\nreminds me of some of the real leadership of folks like Yvonne Chinard with Patagonia and the the\n\nfolks out at Cliff bar and others who you know have chosen to stay sort of independent and continue\n\nto grow and provide the leadership that that that independence allows it’s a lot easier to focus on\n\nyour mission when you don’t have shareholders free that on your neck that’s right that’s right\n\nnow we’re in a good spot for that yeah that’s great Mike well listen I first heard about zeal Opticss\n\na few years ago now at a presentation here in town with folks from the story of stuff yeah\n\nright and um I would love if you could tell us a little about what they’re up to and how that\n\noverlaps with what you guys are doing so they are very focused on the life span of products yeah\n\nand you know really dissecting what goes into things and getting people to think about what\n\ntheir decisions as consumers what our decisions as businesses mean to the impact on our environment\n\non our society and you know that really resonated when I started talking with Steve Wilson who used\n\nto be there who was leading the talk here and you know he had some incredible conversations that’s\n\ngreat to hear that’s how you connected with the brand and has really you know let us to continue\n\nto focus on how we’re continually improving what we’re doing that’s great yeah I appreciate that\n\nand I think we’ll probably make a quick reference to a story of stuff in the show notes if folks\n\nare interested in diving deeper on that so I want to I want to kind of geek out a little bit on the\n\non the technical stuff so what what’s going on with the materials can we talk like polymers or you\n\nknow extrusion technology I don’t know what are you guys doing so I mean the primary story from\n\na raw material standpoint is on our sunglasses so the majority of our sunglasses are made with a\n\nmaterial we call z resin in the frames and aluminum polarized in the lenses and that is all derived\n\nfrom the caster plant so the caster plant is basically a weed that grows on you know marginal\n\nagriculture lands can be growing on the you know edges of you know other fields etc and we heart\n\nwe harvest this in Switzerland and if anybody’s familiar with caster oil that nasty taste and stuff\n\nit’s super easy to produce and it has very similar properties to your typical petroleum based oils\n\nso rather than using the petroleum based oil we replace that with the caster oil and it makes for\n\nyou know incredibly lightweight and durable material for the frames and there’s super clear\n\nmaterial for the lenses and you know it’s really interesting when people hear it’s sustainably\n\nfocused products or materials they typically think there’s going to be a trade off so it’s either\n\ngoing to be more expensive or you know subpar quality and the majority of our sunglasses are at\n\n149 in the US which is right on par with substantially you know poor Opticsal quality products out\n\nand we have the same we have the same warranty the same quality standards that Maui Jim does for\n\ntheir frames so you know from a quality standpoint and a price you really the advancements in\n\nplastics in plant-based plastics has come a long way and if I can touch on another material we\n\njust launched we just launched a new sunglasses frame that’s called C-grass so that’s made from a\n\nmixture of recycled PET and agricultural grasses so like waste products from hemp rice straw I think\n\nlike the stocks of those and those get mixed together and you know that that chase from the\n\nagriculture materials is almost like a rebar in concrete so it makes it again super lightweight\n\nincredibly durable and you can see the little flex of grasses in there so each frames a little bit\n\ndifferent but the feel on it is super smooth it’s almost like a matte rubber and I want to show you\n\nsome of those here in a little bit but it’s really exciting on that always looking for new materials\n\nyeah that’s really exciting and let me just mention folks that we’ve got a very special\n\nfor-profit nonprofit partnership going and folks can go to zeal Optics slash why on earth in fact I’m\n\nmaybe reading the link wrong we’ll put it in the show notes for sure but at any rate if you go to\n\nthat link you’ll get a 10% discount and some of the proceeds will come back to the why on earth\n\ncommunity to support our podcast series and our community mobilization work so it’s just a great\n\nopportunity not only is there already excellent value but you’re offering folks in our community\n\nanother 10% discount on that yeah and supporting why on earth and all the great work that you guys\n\ndo as well which is a big part of our mission is giving back to organizations such as yours\n\nyeah it’s super appreciated and I got to give you a shout out for connecting us with the folks\n\nover at 1% for the planet and now why on earth is one of the nonprofits approved in that ecosystem\n\nand of course we recently published a podcast with Kate Williams the CEO over there and they’re\n\ndoing so much work so it’s this kind of collaboration is the sort of thing I get really excited about\n\nand love mentioning that in the sustainable development goals that our global community has\n\ncreated together of which there are 17 the final the 17th is partnerships in collaboration\n\nand I think this is a really fun example of what that can look like walk the talk yeah exactly\n\nexactly well let me ask you about some of the other partnership work your guys are doing I know\n\nyou’ve got a really special thing going on with the National Forest Partnership for Tree Planting\n\nyeah so we work with the National Forest Foundation here in the US and each year we run a campaign\n\ncalled by a zeal planetary and it actually started this last Monday on November 16th and runs\n\nthrough the end of the year so this is the fifth year we’ve been doing it and it started by you\n\nknow just you know partnered with the NFF which is the marketing arm of the National Forest Service\n\nand we were just doing the plantings for things sold on our website and our staff the\n\nMaui Jim staff our retailers got so far behind it that we’re now doing it in every channel of trade\n\nglobally we are we’re fortunate through Maui Jim to have distribution centers all over the world\n\nand have grown like crazy in Canada Europe Australia so for this year we’ve added tree Canada as a\n\nrecipient in Canada and planted arc which runs the seedling bank and national tree day down in\n\nAustralia so really cool to see the momentum on that last year we planted 10,000 trees with this\n\ncampaign and this year we’re looking to grow that by 50% so hopefully we’re able to meet our goals\n\nwith COVID this year it’s definitely going to be an interesting one but you know excited to be\n\nyou know right in the heart of of this additionally for every pair of sold on giving Tuesday through\n\nour partners we’ll be planting 10 trees as well so perfect timing to go to that link that Aaron’s\n\ngoing to publish in here and give back to the Y on Earth and plant 10 trees in our National Forest\n\nyeah that’s really what a win win win this is when we’re talking about regenerative economics and\n\nhow to put value into a bunch of different localities and actions with a single purchase like\n\nthis man that that is so powerful yeah and you know a lot of us enjoy wearing sunglasses many of us\n\nneed goggles and so when we’re making these purchasing decisions I’d love that this provides\n\nan option to do so much good with that yeah with all the fires that we’ve seen this year as well\n\nthere’s so many areas that are in dire need of reforestation to you know keep our\n\nsoil on the land yeah no doubt about it no doubt and then it sounds like in the summertime you’ve\n\ngot another program you’re doing that focuses more on the oceans is that right yeah so this uh\n\njust this year in 2020 we had plans to launch a program called Shades for Seas yeah I was supposed to\n\ngo on all of Earth month but every place was pretty much locked down at that point so we wound up\n\nlaunching it in June of this year but basically we took that concept and worked with an organization\n\ncalled plastic bank up in British Columbia it has a very cool model if you’re not familiar with it\n\nbut basically they work with communities around the globe to buy recovered plastics and then\n\nthey pay them in what’s basically a micro loan to you know sponsor you know small economies in\n\nthese areas and get them out of recurrent poverty but anyway for every pair of sunglasses goggles\n\naccessory lenses and e-zeals that were sold during that time we pulled five pounds of plastic out\n\nof the ocean well and you know the goal is to make this an annual thing just like by a zeal\n\nplanetary and run that for all of Earth month with you know kind of the uh climax around it on\n\nEarth Day that is so cool wow and that’s called plastic bank yes okay great yeah I’ll make\n\nnote of that as well um this is so exciting so let me uh remind our audience that uh this is\n\nthe why on earth community podcast and I’m your host Aaron William Perry and today we’re visiting with\n\nMike Lewis the director of marketing at zeal Opticss I want to give a shout out to our sponsors\n\nand uh some of the wonderful companies we’re collaborating with to make this podcast series possible\n\nas well as our community mobilization work and uh that includes earth coast productions\n\nthe LIDGE family foundation alpine botanicals purium earth hero vera herbals growing spaces\n\nsoil works earth water press one percent for the planet zeal Opticss doctor browners and\n\nwheylay waters also a huge shout out to our ambassadors and others in the why on earth community\n\nwho have joined our monthly giving program and if you haven’t joined yet you can go to\n\nwhiners.org click on the donate button and set up any amount you’d like on a monthly basis\n\nif you give at certain levels 33 dollars and above you’ll get monthly shipments of the hemp\n\ninfused aromatherapy soaking salts from wheylay waters and they’re sourcing that hemp from\n\norganic and biodynamic growers uh here in calirato so it’s another example of the\n\nwin-win regenerative economics that we’re all developing together so just a huge thanks to\n\neverybody uh making all this possible and again uh remember there’s a special link uh\n\nthat we’re providing so that you can get to zeal Opticss and uh get your 10 percent discount while\n\nalso uh helping to get some of those proceeds also back to the why on earth uh for that work\n\nso uh we’ll say also zealOpticss.com um you can connect with mike and his team on social media\n\nit’s at zealOpticss on instagram, facebook, twitter and youtube and uh we’ll also mention\n\none percent for the planet uh and they’re at one percent for the planet.org and uh national\n\nforests.org is a resource you can go to on the tree planting work that’s being done\n\nso let’s talk real quick about uh one percent for the planet and how you guys are collaborating\n\nand kind of what’s happening in in that ecosystem. yeah definitely um it’s such a cool organization\n\nand let’s just catch you not with our uh regional um contact for them uh yesterday and really need to\n\nhear that they have added over 2,000 businesses this year and that the brand awareness around one\n\npercent is up to almost 40 percent here in the states and growing by leaves and balance internationally\n\nbut what that organization does is to become a member of it as a business you have to um dedicate\n\none percent of your gross sales to nonprofits that work on sustainability such as why on earth\n\nand for nonprofits to become a part of that they have to be vetted to show that their work is\n\ndirectly giving back to creating more sustainable ways of life and you know giving back to the\n\nplanet as well yeah so you know not only is it a way as a business to ensure that you are giving\n\nto you know verified and reputable nonprofits but as you know a person in our society to better\n\nbet when a company says they’re doing good and are focused on environmental issues that they’re\n\nnot greenwashing you know this is a seal of approval that is very well vetted as well as on\n\nthe nonprofit side too so it’s a great way to channel programs like buy a seal planetary shades\n\nfor seas and then you know all of the other things that we do throughout the year as well yeah it’s\n\nso wonderful and you know 1 percent off of the top line that’s often a very substantial portion of\n\na company’s profits and you know if a company’s you know say doing 10 percent net profits you know\n\nthat 1 percent represents 10 percent of those profits it’s a very significant commitment\n\nand I’d love to that they’ve recently launched a program where we as individuals\n\ncan engage and give 1 percent of our earnings for the work we’re doing at the individual level\n\nand we’re actually in the process of developing a whole system of achievement badges for our\n\nambassadors okay and one of them is becoming a 1 percent contributor so that’s another fun\n\nway for us all to kind of engaging this work together and with our ambassadors with these badges\n\ncoming out soon a way to sort of demonstrate what you’ve already accomplished see what more there is\n\nyou can do and kind of see what each other is up to very cool so yeah that’s a fun thing we got\n\nin the works right now it’s also really neat you know we talked about you know partnerships as\n\nthe 17th point for why on earth yeah they are very focused on getting like-minded businesses\n\ntogether so that you know we can have a larger reach there’s a front-range steering committee\n\nthat we serve on and you’ll work very closely with regional businesses as well as international\n\nbusinesses through other avenues and being that it’s the holiday season there’s a auction going\n\non at 1 percent of the planet where hundreds of their member organizations have donated items\n\nthat you can bid on and there’s some really cool stuff on there for you know very reasonable amounts\n\nthat all goes back to 1 percent of the planet very cool I have to check that out you know I think\n\nalso it’s great to hear about what’s going on regionally with the collaborations through the\n\nnetwork and it’d be fabulous to learn a little more about how we and our team can plug into that\n\na bit more we’ve got our next meeting in late January so that just came on the calendar today\n\nso I’d love to get you out that I think that’d be really neat it’s a good group of folks great\n\nsure you’re familiar with a lot of them already so maybe yeah it’d be fun might be a nice way\n\nto network some more well what do you think should we do a little walk around to her yeah let’s do\n\nit yeah where do you want to start um you would think everybody’s got a pretty good view of this area\n\nyeah I’m gonna get behind the camera so here we go this is also our global headquarters behind\n\nthe this little hallway over here is all of our offices this is where we run marketing sales\n\nevents normally events that is and all the logistics and operations for the company so we use\n\nthis showroom as a way to try out marketing concepts new displays to show our retail partners how\n\nthe brand can live and breathe in a physical space and typically as Aaron was mentioning we usually\n\ndo a ton of events in here we have a monthly event series where we bring people together our\n\nambassadors other organizations we work with to have educational series tales of adventure and\n\nfind ways we always have a nonprofit partner around those as well so really looking forward to for\n\nthose days to come back we can get about a hundred people in here and then this is a good little\n\nupdate for presentations but for the most part at this point it’s our selling area and if this\n\nis a look at some of our older goggles these are our sale products right now and I’ve taken a\n\nfocal point as we’re coming into the holiday season and as we kind of pan around here\n\nyou’ll see some of our displays you know being from Colorado as a brand and a lot of us as\n\nindividuals we’ve really taken elements from nature here all of our displays are going to be\n\nwood and cold road steel and backdrops that feature you know mountains capes from the lands that we\n\nlove over here we have some of our more performance styles as well as our auto sun glasses which\n\nare polarized in photocromic so get a change tint throughout the day so you only need one pair of\n\nshades if you’re fly fishing trail running things along those lines and you’ll see a much larger\n\nfocus on goggles right now than typically as the resources starting to open up snow start to fly\n\nhere and we’re all getting super stoked and hoping it’s a big winner to come so this is a few of our\n\nhatchet goggles feature our rail lock system that allowed it to slide in like this great for the\n\nbackcountry you can stay up for a little extra bending and then very similar\n\nyou’re going to be editing this little bit right no it’s okay perfect keep rolling we’ll move on\n\nto auto sun and then also our automatic lens so like the auto sun on the sunglass side this lens\n\nis going to transition it’s polarized in photocromics perfect for you know when it’s sunny in the\n\nmorning snowstorm rolls in and one lens for every condition best lens out every is wow give a\n\nproduct plug that’s great that’s exciting and then as we follow around you’re going to see you know\n\nmore of our goggle line along the walls here some more sunglass displays\n\nwe’re going to be some of our newer more fashion focused displays that greet you as you come in\n\nthe store and then some of the homemade displays that we built here that really tied the brand\n\ntogether that leveraged the materials and you know design inspiration that you know we focus on\n\nbut the the violin here is super laid back we’ve got a great team of people working in here\n\nthat are always happy to explain a bit more about who we are as a brand you know we’d like to be\n\nmore than just a you know seller of sunglasses you know we don’t want to be thought of just as a\n\npiece of plastic that you put on your face but you know an organization that focuses on how you can\n\ntell a story how you can vote with your dollars and how you can promote conscientious consumerism\n\nin everyday purchases awesome and what do you have over here so getting back into our sunglass\n\nline these are going to be some of our newer sports styles and then going into some of our older\n\nstyles shields more performance side of things and then this is kind of the bar and DJ booth\n\nfor our event series yeah that’s great\n\nbar and DJ booths I got to check that yeah what’s what about this case right here uh\n\ndirectly in front of you so that’s going to be our more fashion focus line and you know part of\n\nthe beauty and real focus of zeal is creating that quiver killer style so you know taking\n\na pair of shades like this that is very lifestyle um focused with kind of a fashion edge\n\nbut adding performance attributes in it so this is going to look just as good at the pool at the\n\nbeach as it will you know on a 20 mile run all of our glasses have pro-flex which is a proprietary\n\nporous rubber so the sweater you get the tackier it gets so they’re always going to stay in place\n\neverything super lightweight and then we also have a line called v light so this infuses microscopic\n\nair bubbles and these come in at less than an ounce with the lenses they look really cool and\n\nthey’re going to be super durable you know stepped on these sad on them they’re going to bounce\n\nright back into shape so the cool part about this is yes they’re even more functional but by\n\nintroducing that air it’s you know it’s still that plant-based material but it’s less of it so\n\nyou know the less you put into it the smaller the footprint is going to be so always looking at\n\nways to you know reduce our material usage and the impact of everything that we’re making\n\nthat’s great Mike and then how about over here at this island so this is going to be our\n\nnew releases so here you’re going to find our newest goggle so for this season we launched a new\n\ntechnology called observation deck technology so ski goggles have been really focused on peripheral\n\nview you know horizontally but when you’re skiing and snowboarding you’re looking down the mountain\n\nso got the idea from looking at an air traffic control tower and ship bridges you know where the\n\nwindows tilt out and these are all structures that are designed to have you know a great visibility\n\ndownwards and physically they’re also designed to block any sort of reflection when the light’s\n\ncoming in so if you look at this it has a 10 degree angle on it which gives you 20% more vertical\n\nfield of view which is you know equates to two to three turns or another rock that you might\n\nhit and also like when it’s sunny out sometimes you can see your cheek from like coming in hitting\n\nyour cheek and bouncing out the lens that too is the thing of the past so super simple ideas like\n\nthe rail access and the idea came from the garage door and you had this came from seeing an\n\nair traffic control tower at the while sitting on a tarmac that’s what I thought as well so\n\nwho would have thought about that’s amazing and then as well I mentioned the sea grass material\n\nthese are those new styles they come in two styles the divide and ask them not sure how well\n\nit’ll show up but if you can see this you’ll see that you can see the flex of the grass within it\n\nyeah I see that yeah I want to feel that yeah oh that’s nice yeah it feels very finished you know\n\nreally well done and you know to have the material story that it does you know that’s\n\nI’m really excited for this piece you’ve seen I’ve seen a lot of other recycled sunglasses that\n\njust look really rough and you know they don’t have that you know it’s a fashion accessory so if\n\nyou’re not meeting people’s wants and desires then you can try all you want to reduce the footprint\n\nbut you have to you know kind of meet that need as well so the the agricultural components\n\nis it always going to include some hemp or does that vary sometimes that does vary in production the\n\nthe goal is to get it to a point you know like and made its pipe dream maybe not no pun intended\n\nbut to be manufacturing I’m here in Colorado with the agricultural hemp here yeah that’s\n\nreally exciting so you’ve mentioned you’ve got hemp you’ve got straw what were a couple of the\n\nother rice and flax are the four grasses that they’re using yeah oh that’s super interesting\n\nyeah I mean we’re seeing hemp going into building materials all kinds of different products\n\nit’s exciting to see how that plus other agricultural residues are sometimes called yeah\n\ncan be utilized and finding uses for what would it you know normally be considered trash or\n\npreviously considered trash yeah definitely an area we need to continue to explore yeah yeah so from\n\nhere we’ve got a pretty cool shot of the the what do you call it the DJ booth slash register\n\nslash checkout stands yeah that is so fun and yeah you know I I will reiterate this is one of my\n\nfavorite stores to visit and I don’t visit too many stores I’ll admit it just has such a nice\n\nvibe in here it’s it’s got that kind of home woodsy mountain cheery joyful vibe that I you
