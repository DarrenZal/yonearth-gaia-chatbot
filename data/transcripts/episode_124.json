I’m your host, Aaron William Perry. And today\n\nwe’re visiting with a good buddy of mine, Nick DiDominico, the founder of Elk Run Farm\n\nand the co-founder of drylands aggro ecology research. Hey Nick, how you doing man?\n\nHey, doing pretty good. Hello everybody. Good to be on with you. Yeah, likewise man. I’m\n\npsyched to have this chat with you today and we’ve got so much to chat about with\n\nrespect to the work you’re doing in the regenerative agriculture and regenerative\n\nculture movements and yeah just really looking forward to being able to share\n\nyour story with our audience. Thank you. I appreciate it, Ian. Right on.\n\nHailing from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Nick is a regenerative designer\n\nfarmer and builder inspired by indigenous culture and ancient farming practices\n\nhe works passionately to design the future of living systems. In 2015, Nick began\n\nfarming on a barren and dissertified 14 acre parcel of land in rural North\n\nBoulder County, which is where we are currently now called Elk Run Farm. Also\n\nthis is the pilot research project for drylands aggro ecology research or\n\nDar. Today, Nick is working to develop climate change solutions through\n\nregenerative farming, working with private and public landowners across Boulder\n\nCounty and so Nick, we have a deep connection obviously with Y on Earth having\n\nheadquarters here at Elk Run Farm and us living in community together these last\n\ncouple years, which has just been an extraordinary experience and it’s to me\n\nremarkable to witness all that is unfolding here on this property under your\n\nleadership and what’s what’s really amazing is that we’re sitting in a in a\n\nbeautiful lush abundant garden but that this was truly a really barren and beat\n\ndown land not too many years ago and I was wondering to kick things off could\n\nyou could you describe for us you know what this place was like when when you\n\nfirst got here yeah sure thing so this was a rental property for many years it\n\nappeared as though there had been cattle management many years before that there\n\nwas an old infrastructure like a cattle chute behind it was all kind of falling\n\nover and most likely pretty overgrazed by cattle for years before and as far as\n\nwe know nobody had ever tried to grow crops here there’s not ditch rights here\n\nso the water situation is pretty minimal so it wasn’t really looked at as an\n\nagricultural property my family acquired the land originally just to restore\n\nsome of the buildings and fix it up and I decided to start farming here and it\n\nwas been it’s been like a beautiful experimentation of how to use regenerative\n\nagriculture practices and especially design intensive like thoughtful holistic\n\ndesign to build systems that would restore the land and that was really my\n\ninspiration to come here to do that and there the bottom five acres was\n\ncompletely desertified there was no topsoil no vegetation there was a large\n\ncolony of prairie dogs just kind of a controversial issue in Boulder County\n\nwhere we are but really the prairie dogs and that damage ecosystem was just like\n\na representation of what’s possible in Boulder County what’s happening on a lot\n\nof different parcels of land to something not very uncommon around here and we\n\nstarted using different practices I brought NRCS out in 2015 that’s a natural\n\nnatural resource conservation services a department of the USDA started\n\nafter the dust fall in the 1930s to help farmers and ranchers conserve\n\nresources on land in America and you know originally I asked them hey I showed\n\nthem around showed them the different conditions of the site asked them what\n\nkinds of conservation practices should I use I’m a beginning farmer really\n\nexcited to grow here really excited to run livestock and they basically said\n\nnow we don’t have a lot for you we don’t have a lot of practices that can\n\nactually repair this land we think it’s better if you go farm somewhere else so\n\nthat was a little disheartening at the time but it really stoked this\n\ninspiration to develop these different practices that we’re using now I suppose\n\nsuccessfully you know it’s been been some years now seven years since I moved\n\nhere and a lot of beauty has occurred a lot of community has now joined us here\n\nin what we’re doing and we’re able to feed a lot of people off this land that\n\nwas considered marginalized was considered you know useless for agriculture by\n\nby common understanding until we began working it so that’s just a little bit\n\nof the background that’s then yeah yeah it’s really in look I not only is this\n\ndesertification happening in this specific area Boulder County next to the\n\nRocky Mountains in Colorado but this is happening all around the world in many\n\ndifferent situations and localities and so you know from my\n\nperspective much of what you’re doing here is not only applicable right here in\n\nBoulder County and in the semi-air and Rocky Mountain West but really in\n\nplaces all around the the world and I know you’re increasingly connecting with\n\nfolks in other regions of the planet and I’m so excited to know that there’s\n\nmore and more collaboration getting underway there but before we kind of talk\n\nabout this global context tell me wake what are what are you growing here I\n\nmean I know I get to see this so often and yeah but by the way the soil itself is\n\nthis amazing almost pulsing rich dark chocolate cake fluffy soil now and it\n\nwasn’t like that a few years ago right so yeah maybe describe for us what’s\n\nwhat’s being grown here and you know plants and animals yeah definitely so we’re\n\nsitting here in the forest garden which we always saw as like the nucleus of the\n\nproperty I thought of it in this kind of way like if we could bring fertility and\n\nan ecosystem into the nucleus that would spread throughout the property and so\n\nthat’s really where we began working really with this forest ecology model in\n\nmind so dug this forest garden dug the contour swales that now collect the\n\ngray water and the rain water from the house and begun planting perennial crops\n\nso different fruiting and berry crops that create this natural ecosystem and\n\nthen planting it with other beneficial plants flowers and other plants that\n\nbring bugs that work against the other pests and things like that but\n\nbasically we’re growing fruit crops as the overstory in this forest garden and\n\nthen while the canopy is developing we’re growing vegetable crops sort of in\n\nthe alleys between the contour swales and that’s helping to build soil using\n\nthese no-till gardening practices that we’re using so all the vegetables that we\n\ngrow in this property are in this forest garden here and then we are also\n\ngrowing staple grain crops so mostly bioregional crops I originally got those\n\nseeds from Rich Packararo of Mossas seed foundation one of the elder seed\n\nfarmers and seed libraries in this area and got from him some of the most\n\ndrought tolerant grains that we could that he knew of and especially the\n\nSouthwest traditional foods really so blue corn amaranth and dry beans we\n\ntested a couple different varieties and then settled on Hopi black beans and\n\nthen we’ve been breeding his Chihuahua blue so those are all in breeding trials\n\nand grown in drylands fields just a little bit south of here and then there’s\n\nrows of contour swales in between those fields also that create these moist\n\nmicro climates and hedgeros to block wind and then at the same time we are\n\nraising sheep on pasture in regenerative systems and then the pigs really were\n\na major force here for a long time and now our our pig herds are on other\n\nproperties which is pretty cool we use the pigs to build a lot of soil and to\n\nprepare the ecosystems for later planting which is really neat just utilizing\n\nthis concept that directing livestock to certain areas with certain goals in\n\nmind of hours to transition the ecosystems into more fertile places for\n\ngrowing so pigs were used for a lot of that and then we have chickens for eggs and\n\nmobile coops and then we have ducks that hang out in the ponds and then\n\ndeer and elk come through the property which is pretty neat as well and then at\n\nthe same time we’ve been able to establish over a thousand fruit and useful\n\ntrees in the dry land systems as a way to create ecosystemic resilience to\n\ncreate food and habitat for livestock it’s been really beautiful to see that\n\nI think one of our claims to fame I suppose is the thousand trees that have been\n\nestablished without supplemental irrigation and so at the same time we’re\n\nbreeding those drought tolerant silvo pasture and agroforestry crops for use on\n\nother projects as we continue to grow and expand which is pretty neat too and I\n\nthink it’s important just to mention that this site has really been an\n\nexperimentation site for a long time and now a demonstration of these dry\n\nlands restoration techniques using agro ecology as an overarching concept and\n\nespecially nestled in holistic design methodologies yeah it’s so great like\n\nnot only is the forest garden here a nucleus for this farm really elk run as a\n\ndemonstration has become a nucleus in a broader ecosystem here with a number of\n\nother farms and properties and even some public lands where you’re now doing\n\nthis regenerative work over a lot of additional acreage right and so that\n\nthere’s this great ecosystem community ecosystem of other farmers and other\n\nstakeholders who you you’ve really helped anchor and catalyze what is really a\n\nmovement occurring here in this part of the county now and I’m wondering you\n\nknow if you might share with us a little bit about what what’s that like for you\n\nas you’re going to other sites and working with other landscapes and\n\ndreaming and visioning and designing what what’s possible on these other\n\nproperties yeah it’s been really cool so it’s been three or four years now since\n\nsome landowners began kind of knocking on our door intrigued at least and\n\nsometimes impressed by what we’ve been able to create with such little water I\n\nmean just for context to all the water for this property comes from a 40-foot\n\ndeep well often runs dry as Aaron knows to sometimes we go to turn on sink\n\nwater shower water nothing nothing comes out irrigated a little too much\n\ntonight before you know so there’s been a lot of boundaries challenges like\n\nrestrictions on this property and so it’s been really amazing getting to\n\ndesign bigger systems on bigger properties sometimes with irrigation you know\n\nat times people come to us and want to develop regenerative patterning right so\n\nbuild systems where regenerative farming can plug into quickly and easily that\n\nreally models natural ecosystems and so that’s been super fun and then just\n\nstarting to get into this world of okay the city and the county or different\n\nlandowners have these parcels land they’re incredibly dry and credibly\n\nbarren can’t be leased for agriculture can’t be used in any agricultural models\n\nthat are commonplace in this area right now so just being able to pioneer these\n\nnew systems and like starting with design and then implementation of systems\n\nthat continuously upgrade the land even if there aren’t people tending and\n\nmanaging the land but then of course in like very strongly stoked by management\n\nespecially livestock so really falling in the footsteps of Alan Sabre’s\n\nmodels and using holistic management and regenerative rotational grazing\n\npatterns to restore land and that’s been really exciting too and just really\n\nagain with this concept that the trees and the shrubs anchor the ecosystem so\n\nbuilding perennial systems that can support pollinators and support wildlife\n\nlike birds and just create these thriving thriving agricultural ecosystems\n\nthat continuously produce more and more food every year so that’s been really\n\ncool and our dream is to see all of Boulder County utilizing regeneratively\n\ngrown meat that’s sinking carbon every year that’s continuously building\n\necosystems and demonstrating how using these practices we can actually reverse\n\ndesertification over large acreage just by using these design methodologies\n\nwith the plantings the contour swales to collect store and distribute water and\n\nI think that’s something important to talk about too that really sets us apart\n\nfrom most to is just using holistic water management strategies especially\n\nterraforming to collect and store moisture which creates soil conditions viable\n\nfor planting trees where otherwise that wouldn’t be possible and then a lot of\n\nthe patterning that we use is in these contour systems and then running the\n\nlivestock through contour alleys and building soil fertility using the livestock\n\nand then cropping thereafter where it’s appropriate and it’s been really cool\n\nwe have some bigger partners locally all of our pigs right now are at\n\nMedicarbon organic farm which is just across the street so it’s pretty fun if you\n\ngo to the top of our hill you can look over and see beyond our gates beyond our\n\ncontour swales and trees in the distance another 10 or so acres of contour\n\nswales at Medicarbon and our pigs are over there preparing a dry pasture field\n\nthat a hardy our partner wants to turn into vegetable production so just these\n\nreally low input systems that will eventually grow a lot of veg which is\n\nreally neat too and then using the livestock integration interseasonally to\n\nclear and fertilize the fields which is really neat so that’s limiting\n\ntractor use limiting carbon carbon output and then over at yellow barn farm\n\nanother big partner of ours we just got big grant funding to design the\n\nback 60 acres of that property so the next really large drylands silvo\n\npasture demonstration there you have this idea that silvo pastors the concept of\n\nplanting trees within pastures or in more wet areas turning woodlands into\n\nsilvo pastures by thinning trees but in this area for us it’s really like\n\nplanting trees within pasture to create food and habitat for livestock and really\n\nanchor the ecosystems like I’ve been saying so it’s been really cool just being\n\nwatching the patterns grow outside of our gate and seeing how it’s thriving in a\n\nlot of different conditions locally which has been really neat yeah it’s so\n\ntremendous and in look I don’t I don’t know if the cameras or the mics are\n\npicking up any of the we’ve got some kids it sounds a little upset in the\n\nbackground and one of the other things happening with the organization and\n\nwith the property is a full farm school for the little ones who from the\n\ncommunity here get this really special experience of basically being outside all\n\nof the time that they’re here experiencing the animals and the landscape the\n\nplants learning about different plant edible plants and herbs and and yeah\n\nit’s it’s wild of course it’s not exactly funny but sometimes you know we\n\nget to hear the kiddos getting a little upset or whatever going on and\n\nmiss Jess and the rest of the team do such a good job of helping helping the\n\nyoungsters learn some of these emotional management skills and sort of\n\nembodied awareness skills and as a parent I really marvel at and and\n\nadmire and respect the work that those teachers are doing with those kiddos\n\nand I know that it’s just another way in which you guys have created a hub for\n\nthe community here so you know not only are these kiddos getting to\n\nexperience this land and ecology but of course their parents as they’re\n\ncoming and going each day also gets to have an experience that’s perhaps a\n\nlittle different from their you know otherwise day-to-day reality and so\n\nyeah it’s it’s really amazing to me Nick the way you guys have layered in so\n\nmany functions right to kind of borrow a permaculture idea of stacked\n\nfunctions you’ve layered in so many functions to this to this property and to\n\nthis area this region and look like when when you’re doing these installs on\n\nother properties like we did a season or two ago at yellow barn farm several of us\n\ngot together and planted I don’t know how many hundreds of trees and it was a\n\ngreat fun time there’s a food truck and I think some music and you know it’s a\n\nreal is a really like wonderful weekend experience for all of us who were there\n\nand we managed to help basically install a significant part of this alley\n\ncropping out agro forestry silver pasture system that you’ve designed there\n\nand I wanted to ask you’re thrown out some terms and I heard you you know\n\ndescribing the agro forestry silver pasture piece I I want to ask you to\n\ndescribe the terraforming as well and also a term we haven’t yet mentioned\n\ncalled stun I think it’s a really interesting way to cultivate certain certain\n\nplants in these systems that’s so maybe you could tell us a bit more about what\n\nis terraforming mean and then what’s the stun method yeah totally which\n\nreminds me I mean that term came from Mark Shepherd so I think just just for\n\ncontext to explain like where we got the inspiration to use these models and\n\nwhere like the tell up terraforming and water management systems came from and\n\nMark Shepherd is a farmer up in Wisconsin and he was a region one of Bill\n\nMolison’s original students in the 80s and he Bill Molison being the founder of\n\nthe permaculture movement right with the original literature and all of that\n\nexactly yeah so you know Bill Molison for my understanding collected a lot of\n\nunderstandings and learnings from different indigenous tribes all over the\n\nworld and was really fascinated by traditional farming practices and started\n\nthis movement where called permaculture and I’m sure there’s many many more\n\nresources on that people could explore but Mark Shepherd was one of his\n\noriginal students and was really excited to expand the permaculture\n\nphilosophy and build systems that were agriculturally focused and at scale that\n\nwere profitable at scale and so Mark Shepherd wrote a book called Restoration\n\nAgriculture and I’ve had the opportunity to learn and receive teaching from him\n\nand just utilizing this Restoration Ag model which the first the beginning of\n\nusing that model is really shaping the land to collect store and distribute all\n\nthe moisture that falls on the property and in wetter climates at times that\n\nmeans diverting water so there’s not flooding or topsoil erosion and things\n\nlike that but the terraforming concepts that we use really come from Mark\n\nShepherd and the permaculture kind of framework in that as sheep as water is\n\nflowing down the hill it can either be an erosive force or a force for good in\n\nthat we need that moisture to grow the plants and the crops that we want to\n\nto raise and cultivate and so again using this idea of key line design\n\nthese are concepts that Bill Molison and Mark Shepherd really inspired by\n\nso collecting and storing water high in the landscape and then slowly dispersing\n\nit outwards across the slope so with the concept that water is usually moving\n\nin wet valleys and so if we’re able to collect and store water high we can\n\ndistribute that water onto the dry ridges on the property\n\nand just create way more opportunity for cultivation basically\n\nand that really lays the groundwork so those are all really intensively designed\n\nsystems and then dug either by hand or with machinery\n\nso these small basins that we call contour swales like a ditch on the contour of\n\nthe land that slows and spreads the moisture and then creates a\n\nlocation that we can plant perennial crops like trees and shrubs\n\nand then Mark Shepherd came up with this concept called stun right\n\nsheer total utter neglect so this concept that we’re not really bathing\n\nanything that we’re planting or growing here\n\nwe’re just witnessing watching observing what’s thriving what’s doing well\n\nand in a way this is created a really wonderful opportunity for us when we\n\nbegan planting that these thousand or so trees on contour\n\nwe had no idea if they would grow or succeed or not\n\nand so we planted them very dense like about a foot apart assuming we would\n\nlose at least half the trees and amazingly in year one we had lost less\n\nless than 15% of them which we’re really shocked and stunned us\n\nas well as the other folks in the area especially other farmers that\n\nreally discourage me from practicing these techniques thinking that would be\n\na big expenditure of resources and not be fruitful\n\nand what’s amazing is that the trees have grown really well\n\nand set in motion a breeding program so as the years go on we’ll be able to\n\nselect and then breeding cultivate what does well here\n\nin these really intense harsh dry conditions and then those crops will be\n\nwhat we use later to plant on other projects and so creating this huge\n\nopportunity to develop agroforestry crops for\n\ndrying and drought prone areas which has been really neat too\n\nI don’t think agroforestry is a it’s not really utilized much in\n\ndrier areas where trees don’t grow as easily and so we’re\n\nusing these terraforming techniques to create opportunity to grow many more\n\ntrees that again really anchor the ecosystem create more micro\n\nclimates and all the other ecosystemic functional benefits that\n\nallow us to grow crops and livestock more easily in\n\ndifficult conditions yeah that’s really so interesting\n\nyou know it’s reminding me I learned something\n\nwhen I was interviewing Tom Chi at one ventures and he’s a remarkable\n\ntechnologist and investor who is finding these\n\ntechnology opportunities to help restore coral reefs to help\n\non a massive scale replant parts of the\n\ntropical rainforests around the world and one of those plays is a\n\na drone seed planting technology and I was asking him well\n\nwhat are the success the germination the survival rates of the seeds you’re\n\nputting in the ground and I forget exactly what the numbers were\n\nthey’re actually also pretty high but he said and by the way\n\nwhat are we comparing to as a baseline he said because in nature\n\nyou know trees and plants are dropping\n\nhuge quantities of seeds in general yeah and and only a small percentage of\n\nthose is typically going to mature into a a big\n\ntree like this and what is this like the crab apple we’re\n\nadapted with apple and you know and so okay interesting if we’re looking to\n\nnature as the example that that’s quite quite\n\nquite different probably than when we’re thinking about conventional\n\nagriculture yeah and we’re sort of pushing for that last\n\npercent of yield all the time and I’m just I’m struck because what\n\nhappens in this stun method in these drylands environments right is those\n\ntrees and shrubs that do get established and do get going after a couple\n\nfew years are so hardy yeah they’re they’re essentially ready to\n\ntolerate kind of anything that gets thrown at them\n\nor so it seems yeah and so this is also I think a really important\n\nstrategy for resilience building in these regions of the world and\n\nvirtually all the world right now is at risk where we’re anticipating\n\ngreater extremes and weather patterns and in\n\nclimatic shifts and so on and I guess I want to ask\n\nin that related to that what are you seeing in the way of\n\npolicy conversations and even some of the funders you’re working with\n\nas these strategies and solutions being specifically\n\napropos for climate stabilization and dealing with things like water\n\nin time and carbon sequestration and so on like is that a big part of your\n\nguys conversation yeah definitely I mean from our research\n\nwe’re understanding that about 40 percent of the earth’s surface has been\n\ndegraded by human influence and so most of those areas are what Alan\n\nSabre would call brittle ecosystems places that if\n\nif degraded to a certain point kind of start to roll towards\n\ndesertification and so there’s many places on earth that are facing the same\n\ncrises that we are and just with the industrialized\n\nfood models that are so prevalent on earth right now\n\nit’s like food can be brought long distances to places that have already\n\nbeen desertified but really understanding that by having local food everywhere\n\npeople are especially in desertifying places we can really build huge\n\nresilience in our communities and also understanding that\n\nthe health of the land really is the health of a community and when you really\n\nboil it down and in a way like our values as a culture on earth maybe have\n\nstrayed away from that and valuing other things but really\n\nall natural resource comes from the health of the land and so\n\nin these practices we are growing food resiliently in really difficult\n\nconditions that were otherwise not seen as applicable for growing food and at\n\nthe same time building resource in our communities\n\nbuilding skills by bringing other people onto the sites and projects to learn\n\nabout it there’s just huge opportunity to\n\nimplement these practices all over the world for\n\nmajor benefit to society and humankind as we know it\n\nyeah absolutely now i’m also reminded of our mutual friend and colleague\n\njohn lou who helped establish the global\n\necosystem restoration camp movement right and yeah i remember learning from him\n\nthat the Sinai peninsula you know that whole region\n\nhad a very different gulf stream flow of air and moisture off of the Indian\n\nocean and it was probably because of these human impacts of\n\ndesertification that that all shifted so that it became even more extreme uh\n\nin its uh drought and uh desert uh situation\n\nbut the good news is there are efforts underway in places like Sinai and\n\nelsewhere nearby like in Egypt there’s an ecosystem restoration camp there\n\nthat’s doing extraordinary work of uh literally\n\nreinforcing and greening the desert and so you know one of the things i’m\n\nreally struck by uh thinking about some of these\n\nmarginal and in risk areas like we have here\n\nand then places that have already been so extremely\n\ndesertified that it’s a matter of really bringing them back really restoring\n\nregenerating and healing those in a big major way\n\nand i’m curious i know that so much of your\n\nyour work and your focus is right here in this area and thank goodness right\n\nyeah um and may the world have a whole lot of nic d to minicos and\n\nlots of other places but uh also how do you see yourself\n\nin time in the coming months and years and maybe decades um\n\nyou know helping to expand and proliferate your work\n\nand knowledge and expertise into other regions of the world that might benefit\n\nfrom that yeah that’s a great question i mean for us\n\nwe’ve caught some interest and have some potential projects in Ecuador\n\npotential project in Baja California and yeah there’s many places on earth\n\nhave been degraded and mostly by industrial culture so\n\nwe’re just excited to see how that grows and right now we’re just\n\nstabilizing in our local communities and in our local county here in Boulder\n\nCounty i mean there’s just so much to do right around us right now that\n\nseems like that’s what’s captivating most of our focus but in the years to come\n\nwe’re really excited to start taking projects other places and\n\ninvolving local place-based cultures in the in the um work that we’re doing\n\nand just really bring in nurture and support communities\n\nto live in healthy thriving ecosystems where their food is growing\n\nclose by and especially lifting up and utilizing uh bioregional food crops\n\nfrom the different areas that we want to work in so\n\nwe’ll see where it all goes but we’re excited and so more on that soon i’d say\n\nright on that’s great yeah Nick well and look you’ve you’ve uh also\n\nreally connected deeply to a lot of the indigenous people and\n\nindigenous cultures of this region yeah and i’m so excited uh to\n\nto hear from you uh what what that process and that part of your\n\nadventure over the last few years has looked like yeah and how has that\n\ninformed what you’re up to i know you had some really tremendous\n\nexperiences in the Amazon and Peru yeah obviously not local\n\nyeah but but you’ve also cultivated some very deep and beautiful\n\nrelationships with indigenous elders and wisdom keepers and others\n\nhere right in this region can you share a bit with us about that\n\nyeah definitely and for me i think my path towards land stewardship really\n\nbegan when i was in South America and i left what i was doing in the\n\nUnited States left a competitive skiing career that i was deeply involved in\n\nand sort of had an existential crisis and left and went to South\n\nAmerica just to immerse in indigenous culture and learn about different\n\nmedicine traditions and study and practice and interestingly enough what i\n\nfound there were off-grid communities and some of them beginning to\n\nimplement permaculture design practices and i was just a kid at the time but it\n\nreally left an impression on me and so after some years living and working\n\naround there i came back up into the United States and\n\nreally inspired by a traditional indigenous ceremony of north\n\namerica and especially plains native culture so\n\nsouthwest plains and then up you know these different tribes shayan or apoho\n\napaches different ones that usurome these areas in the in the recent past that\n\nwe’re living in now and just seeing that they’re their ceremonial culture\n\nand they’re they’re understanding of elemental forces and how\n\nhow life is these are just inherent patterns that that all of nature is\n\nfollowing with and so just learning about their techniques of prayer and like\n\nreally technologies of prayer i would call it that have inspired how i approach\n\nall living things how i approach the land how i approach people and just\n\nthese really fundamental and foundational\n\nunderstandings that help me navigate in this world today um\n\nand just this inspiration to want to be close to the land it’s such a\n\ngoes beyond values it’s like a way of being it’s a way of living it’s a way of\n\nthinking that’s just in respect and reciprocity with all of nature um\n\nand so then of course paying homage to these different tribes and\n\ncommunities as well and supporting them how we can\n\nwe have a really cool food sovereignty project just beginning on the shashoni\n\nreservation up in win river and that’s been really exciting to just support\n\nthem beginning to grow their native foods again and to use livestock and like a\n\nmore um innovative way um you know not as much traditional for them but\n\nusing livestock to develop land that they can then garden and just\n\nbe able to take care of themselves again be able to rely on their own food\n\nsovereignty to support their tribal communities and everything that they do\n\nwhich has been really beautiful to see but it’s just been such a deep part of\n\nhow we move how we
