of the Stewardship and Sustainability Podcast\n\nseries brought to you by the YonEarth Сommunity.\n\nMy name is Aaron Perry and I’m here today with Chef Maria Cooper, I’m Maria.\n\nAnd I’m so excited that we get to talk today with you about food, nutrition, different\n\ncultural inspirations and even familial inspirations behind food.\n\nAnd some of you who may know me know that food is one of my very favorite and dear passions\n\nand I like to say eating is one of my favorite sports.\n\nAnd some of you may also know Chef Maria Cooper is the executive chef at the Highland City\n\nClub in Boulder, Colorado where we have many meetings, discussions, book club discussions\n\nand a variety of authors and thought leaders, impact entrepreneurs and others from the community\n\ncome together and share ideas and time together, often eating Maria’s amazing magical food.\n\nAnd of course we talk in YonEarth that food is so central to our cultivation of relationships\n\nand to our connection with soil and planet and people all over the world.\n\nAnd it’s with that in mind, Maria, I’m so grateful we get to have this discussion with you today\n\nand thank you so much for joining us.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd Maria is the author of Heartful Kitchen, a wonderful cookbook that has amazing features\n\nin it, resources for folks that we’ll be talking about and I highly encourage you all to check that out\n\nat chef Maria Cooper.com and so Maria I want to ask obviously I’ve been nourished by your cooking\n\nfor many years now here in the community and it’s one of my most favorite treats in part of the week\n\nwhen I get to eat a meal that you create and give us what’s the background?\n\nWhat’s the story behind how you’re now nourishing so many people with food?\n\nWell, Aaron, it’s been a pleasure to get to know you and feed you for a while now.\n\nAnd I do love cooking at the City Club, it’s been a pleasure, I’ve been cooking there for about eight and a half years\n\nand prior to that I did some personal chef work and some catering and I’ve often been drawn to people with special diets\n\nspecial diet needs gluten-free, dairy-free and those folks who are even needing even more particular care with their food\n\nsuch as autoimmune protocols diet, fog map, scaps diet, things like that and people come through at City Club sometimes\n\nand have very particular needs with food and so over the years I have been interested in putting together recipes\n\nthat are incredibly clean and low in flammatory and all of that and in fact for myself and my own diet I’ve had to do that\n\nand so about it’s been, let’s see, maybe five or six years ago I got sick with I found out that I had a few different autoimmune issues\n\nand I had to get really clean with food, ridiculously clean, like no gluten, no dairy, no grains, no fruits\n\nhad an issue with insulin, I couldn’t have any sugar, any kind and at the time I was living a very busy life\n\nteaching dance, my partner has a son so there’s a lot going on\n\nand full-time job and so I was trying to make it work in my own home and I was having to find ways of cooking really simply\n\nbut stopping the fridge and thinking in advance and wanting to only cook a few nights a week\n\nand so I created a bit of a system at home and I was inspired to start to write things down\n\nand friends and family for years have been asking me to give them recipes as well\n\nand so it started culminating into this idea of writing a book and this was about five years ago\n\nso anyways that was the start of what is heartful kitchen today but it’s been a five-year project\n\nand a lot of different inspirations that being one the the diet piece of it\n\nanother piece you mentioned the the familial piece and so my my grandmother who’s probably my\n\nnumber one biggest food inspiration she’s a hundred years old now\n\nLebanese grandmother and when I was growing up I would spend weeks during the summer with her\n\nand we would cook Lebanese food together and so I definitely fell in love with food at a very\n\nyoung age and and it was just a blast spending time with her and being very slow with food\n\nand getting my hands into lamb and you know flavoring it up with lemon and garlic and parsley\n\nand tasting the raw lamb before we rolled it up into into balls and doing you know everything\n\nwe did with it putting it into pastry and putting it into the oven and it was just really\n\nspecial times so many inspirations she wrote a cookbook and I it’s not published but that is a\n\nthat is a goal of mine to to get that to press at some point and the publishing company this is\n\na self-published book and I have created a publishing company called Mary Rose Press and her name\n\nis Mary and her middle name is Rose so that is after her and so you can obviously publish her book\n\nthrough that press yeah I hope to do so that is so wonderful I my connection with with food is\n\nvery closely tied to my time with my grandmother in the kitchen as well and she was Slovenian\n\nand so we had this incredible connection to old ethnic recipes and traditions and what\n\nwhat a joy to have that that direct thread and for you to be carrying that forward and sharing\n\nthat now with so many people the way that you are and one of the things I’m struck by and you\n\nare of course a bit of a celebrity here in the community with your food so many folks just\n\nabsolutely rave about the meals you create and one of the things that strikes me as incredibly\n\nprecious in there is that these are delicious flavor bursting experiences that are also so\n\nnutritious and so nourishing for for us and it’s it’s clear when you’re\n\ndishing out for people one by one there’s so much love in what you’re doing and I imagine\n\nthat it has something to do with the relationship with your grandmother and where you’re coming from\n\nwhen you’re preparing food for people yeah and my mom too you know when I am the youngest and\n\nI think busyness was like a thread in my family growing up goes with my grandmother and my mom\n\nbut what by the time I was I don’t know exactly I want to say 10 or 11 my my mom\n\nwent back to grad school and so she was quite busy but when my my older siblings were\n\nwere young she was at home and so I just have memories of her being so full so busy but she would\n\nshe would somehow make space to come home and prepare these amazing dinners every night\n\nand my mom is a fantastic cook like the best like when I when I go home every time I go home it’s like\n\nit’s like it’s the best food I’ve ever had you know so you know simple simple things like\n\nshe makes fish better than anybody so there’s a recipe in the book called a babe’s baked fish and my\n\nmom’s my mom’s name is Linda but everyone calls her babe in her family and so this dish is\n\ngenerally made with cod but you can make it with with any any white fish really and it has pistachio and\n\ncitrus zest and I make it with ghee because I I think he’s a very tasty healthy fat to cook with\n\nwhich you can do it with coconut oil or chicken fat or another healthy fat and it’s so easy you\n\njust put everything in a casserole and stick it in the oven and bring it out and base it with the\n\nfat and the lemon juice and so she had this way of creating dishes that were very simple and very\n\nhealthy and incredibly delicious so yeah it was my grandmother in the summers or when we would go\n\nsee her but throughout life my mom definitely nourished us like through the busyness and and that’s\n\nwhat I’m trying to do with this book you know is is remind people that you know it’s not so bad to be\n\nbusy like we are going to be busy we’re getting busier it seems with our cell phones and our iPads\n\nand everything that we’re multitasking doing but it’s so important to continue to nourish ourselves\n\nand frankly we’re not nourishing ourselves when we go out to eat so often even when we go to\n\nyou know the whole paycheck grocery store and choose to have dinner there over and over like\n\nwe think we’re nourishing ourselves but when we do it so often it’s um we’re not choosing the\n\nhealthiest oils to put into our bodies and to to make choices at home we’re saving time we’re saving\n\nmoney we can eat organic vegetables at prices that aren’t exordated and um and it’s important\n\nto look at the facts that we are we’re cooking with and so there’s lots of tools in the book\n\nthat talk about this not to come from trying to be a perfectionist about food because that’s not\n\nwhat it’s about it’s about relaxing around food really but having all the information of how can we\n\neat a nutrient death diet um you know i think a lot of folks are are eating a more of like an empty\n\ncalorie diet um and because it’s quick it’s quick to choose um more of a carb rich diet\n\nand it’s fun but um but when we’re choosing foods like um you know hearty vegetables\n\ncolor rich vegetables and organic proteins um we’re choosing nutrients and the calories that\n\nwe’re eating have more vitamins and then almost in them so there was um there’s a a toolbar\n\nat the bottom of each recipe in the book and right now the toolbar relates to uh healing diets\n\nthat particular doctors recommend for for patients and some some examples of these diets are\n\nour um fod maps and gaps diet and autoimmune protocol plant paradox um originally when i created\n\nthis this healing diet toolbar was going to include vitamins and minerals so let’s say for example\n\nthis lemon zested garlicky broccoli yeah i just i just opened to this and it’s a beautiful image\n\nso i i think i’ve probably eaten this before and uh i assure you it’s delicious so yeah i see at the\n\nbottom there is this um health food bar right in the guide so what what do these\n\nyeah so so let’s say you follow a fod map’s diet um what is that by the way i’m not\n\nlooking familiar yeah so certain certain diets that i have in this book let’s say so so a good friend\n\nof mine um david to sack who works in the building uh that i that i work in the highland building um david\n\nhelped me some with this project and um brilliant man brilliant doctor part of he started called\n\nmedical and um so david inspired me to create this this medical toolbar and um so fod map’s diet\n\nis a is a diet that he might recommend to a patient who potentially is struggling with a gastrointestinal\n\nissue and to test whose test shows up in a way that says okay this this is indicated that this\n\nperson might need to follow this diet and so for the broccoli dish um if you’re following the\n\nfod maps diet cruciferous vegetables are in no okay so this means that we know go yeah yeah so um\n\nbut then we have plant paradox yeah and then you can have it if you’re plant paradox i’m not\n\ni’m not going to take the time here to go through all of this but um but if you follow these diets\n\nthis book if you follow one of these diets this book will be helpful um in giving you guidance\n\naround each recipe uh huh that’s incredible it’s such a resource yeah it’s a resource in that way\n\nand it could be a resource for um for uh healing healing doctors in that way as well so so i was\n\nsaying a moment ago i was uh considering having vitamins and minerals on this as well and as i\n\nstarted to look through there’s just way too many um like in every recipe there’s there’s so much\n\nand it’s almost just like what’s the point um because every recipe um is very mineral rich\n\nvitamin rich so um yeah it does you it does a good service to to um to look at um\n\nvitamin and mineral rich foods as much as you can nutrient dense foods and a book like this can help\n\nyeah so my my takeaway uh sort of reiterating this for our audience is that we don’t each need to\n\nbecome the expert that you are and and you with access to other experts like medical doctors we\n\ncan get the book and use it as a guide through our own uh healing journeys our own quality of life\n\nimprovement journeys whether it’s having an issue with gluten or dairy or other inflammatory\n\nother uh potential conditions this is a resource any number of us can use and and get wonderful\n\nresults right and you know you you know that when using these recipes um you are\n\ntaxing the body as little as possible there’s no night shades in this book as well um night shades are\n\nfor those of you don’t know vegetables that grow at night potatoes um eggplant peppers tomatoes\n\num so yeah night shade free grains free there’s no fruit in this book except for citrus um so\n\nfor those sensitive beings this is a good book for you for those of you who don’t have issues with\n\nany of that um this is also just a highly um flavorful book i talk about um taste sensations there’s\n\na section on that in this book which which is basically talking about the tongue um so using\n\ntaste sensations as a tool and what what you know of that is is all the flavors so bitter salty sweet\n\nsour and then this new flavor they talk about umami right which is like miso or\n\nyes the way karmichan cheese yes yeah right um spicy pungent even um this flavor fatteness\n\nwhich is which is the way like let’s say we we toss avocado in a dish that’s going to um move\n\nflavor around the tongue so wow so because this book is is limited in things like grains or um\n\num yeah nothing else is coming to me at the moment but we we add a lot of things like citrus zest\n\nand delicious healthy fats and things that really make flavors pop so if um if you can think of\n\nof friends of yours that eat you know they go out and eat burgers and fries and they’re used to\n\nfood like that they’re still gonna enjoy this food because it’s it’s flavor heavy yeah i can\n\ni can attest to that i have had many friends and joy this food as well yeah you mentioned oils\n\na few times and i’m curious tell us a little more about why certain oils are so good for us and\n\nothers maybe are not that good for us it what what’s going on with oils right so um what’s going\n\non with oils well we’ll need like another hour for that but um so the oils episode yeah the oils\n\nepisode um so i can talk about that from my own experience and i i have experimented with\n\nketogenic diet relatively often so when i’m needing to so ketogenic diet is um is a high fat medium\n\nprotein and very low-carb diet and um and it helps if you’re needing to trim up and it helps\n\nif you’re needing to clear brain fog and um it’s it’s pretty magical and it’s difficult\n\nbut when i do it i’ll do it for like i don’t know three or four weeks and so i’ve learned a lot\n\nabout healthy fats when i when i do that and um what i’ve learned and what i’ve studied about\n\nis that there are certain fats that are that are really good for the body and certain fats that\n\naren’t and so the types of fats in this book that i’ve suggested cooking with for high for high\n\ntemperature are um coconut oil uh ghee which is a refined clarified butter is that yeah\n\nghee is um butter without the milk solids right yeah and you can buy it yeah you can make it\n\nyeah usually buy it yeah i know more or more folks seem to be using ghee yeah um my some of my\n\nfavorite fats to cook with are grass-fed beef tallow and um which has really good omega\n\nyeah chicken fat duck fat for Thanksgiving we roasted a duck and made duck soup and then we had\n\nall of this duck fat and we’re still cooking with it and it’s incredible wow yeah and everything\n\njust seems to um work better in the body and so when i say i’m speaking for my experience\n\nwhat’s my experience is when i’m eating fats like this it’s um it’s more harmonious\n\nwell i know you as a friend of many years and i know that you’re very connected to body that you’re\n\nvery body centered in what you do and you’re a dancer you you teach dance and i’m wondering if\n\nyou can share with us a bit about that that body connection as a dancer and how that kind of\n\nrelates over to your work as a chef in your work with food yeah that’s a big question\n\nis that that’s another episode yeah um well i think in general like it’s in everything that i do\n\nin my in my outer world it’s and in my inner world it’s important for me to stay connected to my\n\nbody and and i don’t always i mean i can find myself really in my head at times i think at the club\n\nat city club um i manage quite a bit and um yeah you have a lot of responsibility and i love it\n\nyou know yeah and i really enjoy it but um but if i don’t go out and take that 20 minute walk\n\nlike the days that i don’t do it i notice it yeah and so the balance of um of life is is so important\n\nand um and and it’s important to notice like when when things are off and notice when\n\nwhen i got to go out and take that walk or notice when i haven’t um stop to eat lunch\n\nyeah um when i’ve had too much caffeine and stay in tune with with all of that because it’s it’s\n\nit’s certainly not about getting things perfect because every day i don’t get things perfect\n\nyeah with regards to self care and and just noticing like what’s off how can i get back\n\num there’s a hang of time yeah what do i need now and what’s next and what do i need later at the end\n\nof the day does it need to be a down night do i have it in me to be social um especially with this book\n\nyou know it’s been um it’s been a journey especially the last six months putting this book together\n\nand um and if i didn’t i think i may have told you this the other day but if i didn’t push\n\nthe way that i did it wouldn’t have happened yeah it would have taken another year which\n\nI’m sure you can relate to well the funny thing about books that i’ve noticed is they don’t\n\nwrite themselves no it takes an incredible amount of of sustained uh energy willfulness discipline\n\nuh to put something like this together and uh i i’m so grateful that that you’ve done it because i\n\nknow knowing you and eating your food is often as i do i know this is going to be just an amazing\n\nresource for so many folks folks all over the place folks who you’ll you’ll probably never meet in\n\nperson and uh i’m just grateful that you’ve done the work and taken the the time to make this happen\n\nwhile you’re also an executive chef at a very busy dining facility and doing all kinds of other\n\nthings in your life as well so uh yeah it’s funny you know it’s not it’s not really for me\n\nlike this this book like on a couple different levels so you know when you start writing and you have\n\na folder in your computer and it’s like why don’t we know what this book’s going to be called yet\n\nso why do i call it so when i first started it five years ago it was just called an offering\n\nthat was the name of the folder yeah and um because that’s what it was because it was like okay i’m\n\ngiving this is like a giving giving and um and that’s what this that’s what this is uh i have\n\ni have this coaching business that i’m that i’ve started and i’m working with clients and i’m\n\nteaching them how to cook and they’re most generally people who don’t know much about food\n\ngenerally people who are suffering in some way because they’re nutrient starving you know\n\nthey’re they’re not eating nutrient rich diets they’re eating um empty diets and so but they’re\n\nreally they’re really wanting to create change or else they wouldn’t be asking for help so um\n\nand up until now i haven’t had this available so i’ve just been giving them the book\n\nyou know just been like passing them the book which has been so nice and it’s been uh it’s been\n\nsuch a gift to see these recipes helping people and changing their lives and customizing them\n\nto fit people’s needs yeah because everybody’s different and some people have really special\n\nfood needs it’s such an interesting uh observation that you’re making that is a truism i think for\n\nour culture at this point our society that so many of us are going through day-to-day life\n\nwith incredible caloric intake right we have a very calorie rich\n\ndiet generally speaking but it’s often way too often nutrient bereft nutrient\n\ndevoid and we spoke about this a fair bit in in YonEarth and i think it’s one of the\n\ngreatest opportunities that we have to improve our own health and well-being our own quality of life\n\nfor ourselves the people around us our families and so on and it is also a beautiful way to be\n\nin deeper stewardship of places farms soil people growing food cultivating food those two\n\nreally go hand in hand and uh one of the things that strikes me Maria and uh you your\n\nchefery if that’s a word exemplifies this when we’re talking about increasing health and well-being\n\nthrough our food and beverage choices this is far from an austerity program in my experience\n\nthe food you create is so abundant with flavor is bursting with incredible delightful\n\nindulgence really in in the miraculous abundance of this this planet and my hope is that\n\nfolks will check this out and and experience this for themselves of course if you’re visiting\n\nDenver or Boulder and can come up to the highland city club come for lunch um but you know\n\nshort of that this this is such a tremendous resource around that enjoyment of life that i\n\nbelieve so many of us have in our cultural paratages back generations we have all around the\n\nworld rich traditions around food that are helpful and really enjoyable and i know in addition to\n\nyour Lebanese background with your grandmother you you also have had a restaurant in Spain\n\nand many of your dishes have just an incredible Spanish zest and penache to them so i’m curious\n\ntell us a little about the time in spain and what were you doing that yeah yeah from love with\n\nsaffron so there are it’s funny it’s not a dancer is he yeah let’s not go there\n\nso it’s funny i was making the index and um i realized like how much saffron is in this book plus\n\nthe tremendous amount um so i yeah i think it was gosh nine years ago or eight years ago i was\n\nlooking on Craigslist or looking on yeah looking on Craigslist for a job and i saw that someone was\n\nlooking for a chef for Madrid for a place in Madrid and so i thought yeah i’ll look into that\n\nand so long story short i got hired to open up um help open up a restaurant um in downtown Madrid\n\nand it was called hardest and um they wanted a chef who had been involved with organic food and\n\nthey wanted a boulder chef that you know like big salads because they don’t do that in Spain um so\n\ni and i i helped them i helped create the menu i had like some of my dishes and then helped\n\nthem with with their dishes and um yeah it just helped it was hired to help get it started\n\nso i went over there for a year and um it was a wild experience i didn’t know any Spanish\n\nreally and i went there and i had a team of about five or six people in the kitchen none of them\n\nspoke english i just had my my Spanish book learned on the job and uh yeah it was a trip amazing\n\ni had my grandmother’s hummus recipe on the menu and they still do it there to my knowledge\n\ni think yeah pretty sure they’re still open but it’s it’s been a number of years that’s wonderful\n\nyeah is there a certain dish that you make regularly now that somehow reminds you of your\n\ntiming Madrid well we do pay a relatively regularly um and it’s more like techniques\n\nyou know like different broths that i learned how to do there i worked with a couple chefs there um\n\nthat taught me a lot so i had the opportunity to to work with some great chefs in that kitchen\n\nit was it was lovely it was quite an experience it’s really grateful\n\nit’s so beautiful yeah and it just it tells us a little more about the taste sensations i want to\n\ncome back to that because i have one yeah one of the things that strikes me i was thinking about\n\nthis the other day watching a movie with a lot of our technology of course we’re recording this\n\nwe have audio we have visual yeah what we don’t have is a roma and flavor right and to be able to\n\nattempt to communicate just how amazing this yeah through audio visuals is a bit of a challenge\n\nwith sure we have words so we can attempt it right so there’s this one dish in the book um it’s\n\ncalled sensational fish uh with spaghetti squash anchovies and cavers so um and this dish the\n\npoint of this dish is to highlight all the taste sensations so basically you have your your tongue\n\nand to make a dish taste really powerful if that’s what you’re going for is to hit your whole tongue\n\nand just pop it out right so that’s what this that’s what this does so you have the sour the sweet the\n\nfatty the pungent the umami so for example um i used spaghetti squash at decent amount in this book\n\nbecause it’s comforting right spaghetti squashes is um it’s comforting but it’s very low\n\ncarb it’s very low sugar so spaghetti squash will give you the sweet and that’s the bed of this dish\n\nyou have the umami from the fish because macro you choose between macro or cod in this dish\n\nwhich is a very umami on the umami scale it’s a high it’s high in the umami the fatteness comes\n\nfrom the cooking oil which is your choice of coconut oil or ghee or chicken fat or talo\n\nanother sweet is the caramelized onion you get the pungent flavor from the garlic\n\nmore umami from the anchovy you get the sour from the white wine\n\num you get more fatty from the avocado and then um and then you get the broth that’s underneath it\n\nso something about this book is um the mineral rich bone broth which is um it’s very central to\n\nto this this book many of the recipes have bone broth as uh as an ingredient so um that’s all\n\nI’ll say about that for now but um yeah that’s a little more but yeah it’s kind of a fun recipe\n\nto try it actually uh if you if you aren’t quite ready to buy the book you could go on uh\n\nshethmariecooper.com and this recipe is on the website on the on the blog so share that one\n\nyeah yeah you could grab that one on the website and if if folks are interested in your um\n\nconsulting and coaching service can they find information about that at the web as well?\n\nactually um currently i’m doing free discovery sessions for the coaching so um yeah you can\n\njust schedule a 20 minutes free session with me through the website wonderful yeah wonderful\n\nand maybe i’ll take this opportunity to remind our audience that this is

food maria is making me\n\na little hungry are you hungry of what should we try something i see there’s something amazing sitting\n\nhere and i probably cannot resist it any longer okay all right what do we got so this is a recipe\n\nfrom the book um we have i will let you hold it and maybe i’ll pull the recipe as if we can talk\n\nabout it so these are truffles so i do have some desserts in this book and um these are decadent\n\npower truffles wow and they have no sugar in them they have um i actually did that there’s this\n\nwebsite you can go on and do the whole nutritional breakdown of them so they have i think like\n\none carb in there or something so can i have one yeah you can have one okay i’m going for this kind\n\nwhich one is this they’re the same they just they just have different um topping so this is\n\npistachio dusted and this is um oh my goodness oh my goodness so you can make these with carrot powder\n\nor cocoa powder and the way they’re made is with um coconut milk that’s been reduced a whole lot\n\nso it’s like really really thick and then you stir in um and you kind of nut butter or seed\n\nbutter that you like and there’s a lot of spices there’s fresh ginger there’s a lot going on\n\nthey’re a little cardamom i’m getting there’s um so there’s ginger there’s lemon zest there’s\n\norange zest there’s um there’s so there’s sweetened with stevia but if you can’t do stevia you can do\n\nany kind of sweetener that works for you i like liquid stevia because it doesn’t have\n\nit doesn’t affect your blood sugar anyway in any way and it’s um it’s not bitter like powdered\n\nstevia and there’s not that much in in the recipe these are amazing good there’s vanilla\n\nyeah and you can coat them in whatever you like so and i like to keep them in the freezer\n\nand it’s nice my my partner’s son he likes um sweets and so he eats these and it doesn’t have\n\nany effect on his you know on his wildness he just eats them and they actually study them out\n\nbecause they have the uh the protein in them from the nuts wow so uh is amazing i’m so glad you like\n\nthem and when they when they’re dusted in cocoa they’re really just like eating chocolate\n\nyou know it’s just like eating a chocolate treat but way more nutritious yeah they’re\n\ndifferent breakfast too there’s um a couple more truffle recipes in the book and there’s also a\n\num a avocado mousse recipe which is a really a really nice dessert it’s creamy and it’s made with\n\nuh with cashews wow Maria that’s amazing i might have to put it in order in for some more\n\nyou can have the rest by ten thank you so much yeah you got it so i want to make sure that we’ve\n\ncovered everything we wanted to discuss today before wrapping up i know we’ve got a few minutes\n\nremaining with our episode is there anything on your end that you want to make sure we mention or\n\nhit on um i think we i think we did it yeah i feel like things are pretty covered\n\nnice i’d like to hear about your food my food yeah i’d like to hear about how you’re doing with uh\n\nwith with your cooking and is there anything you want to talk about with your cooking oh my gosh\n\nwell i love eating i love cooking i’m a total amateur and i love hanging out with experts like you\n\nand um one of the kind of grab and go things i enjoy uh throwing in my bag in the morning is just\n\na big hearty salad and that way i know i’m getting my leafy greens my chlorophyll my various\n\ncolors i’ve been really into cucumbers lately for some reason i don’t know exactly why and uh\n\nit’s soup and stew season so yeah making things like chili blanco is uh one of my favorites\n\nwas turkey it’s time of year it could be or with chicken or yeah um other you know other\n\napproaches that i usually make it with pizole in there and quite a lot of cumin it’s very like\n\ncumin intense yeah and uh cumin forward cumin forward yeah um and it’s just it’s so comforting heartwarming\n\nand satisfying what kind of chicken do you get do you get like chicken thighs or do you put a\n\nwhole chicken or yeah generally enjoy uh baking a number of chicken thighs that i’ve seasoned\n\nokay beforehand and i usually do that with skin off and i’m kind of uh one of those weirdos who\n\nreally enjoys baked chicken skin for some reason and i love it i love it yeah so i’ll often have\n\nthat as a treat while i’m preparing the soup and in tearing the the meat up my hand to put into the\n\nthe soup um i think i do a mere plot a little bit at the beginning sometimes but not every time\n\nand there’s usually a fair bit of garlic in there too um so it’s fun it’s easy and if we make a big\n\npot of it uh as you were speaking to earlier there are often you know eight ten twelve meals in there\n\nthat can be ready to roll throughout the week throughout busy days um so that’s a lot of fun\n\nyeah yeah yeah i think um soups and stews right now are are amazing and freezing them and\n\nyou know the one one thing about these uh recipes in this book is most of them are better than\n\nthe next day yeah or the day after that and so um and a lot of them are great in the freezer\n\nand so you know taking the time to make your own um your own chicken broth your own\n\nbone broth is it makes such a difference and it’s so it’s so nourishing\n\nis it a is it a fairly complicated process you know i’m wondering if folks might be a bit\n\nintimidated because it sounds like it could be intimidating no no i mean generally there’s a\n\ncouple different ways you can do it so the way that we do it often is is we like to we like to buy\n\nrotisserie chickens from home foods the organic ones yeah because they’re pretty affordable\n\nmm-hmm i think right now they’re like nine ninety nine right so we’ll buy two and we’ll take the\n\num we’ll take the meat off yeah and we’ll make a big chicken salad for the week would not\n\nto get the fridge and then we have two heart kisses we’ll throw them in a big pot with water\n\nand you put a little bit apple cider vinegar yeah i’ve heard that because that helped my mom\n\nthat hurts take the goodness out of the bones you let sit for an hour turn it on and cook it for\n\nsix hours wow so you let it simmer you let it sit with no heat no heat for an hour then you put\n\nit on heat that’s it yeah i mean at the last hour of cooking you can toss in some uh onions and\n\ncelery carrots if you want but i don’t usually i’ve even heard folks will use their onion\n\npeels and their carrot onions at that stage a way to use some of those things that would\n\nother good wise go to college yeah you can and while you’re cooking through the week if you end up\n\nhaving those a nice thing to do is throw those in a bag in the freezer and then when you’re ready\n\nto make socks you got it ready you got it ready to go that’s such a great idea yeah and um but you\n\nknow having broth um even without the veggies is fine i guess it still makes delicious soup because\n\nusually when you make soup you’re cooking veggies you’re chopping up veggies subtaining them\n\nand then throwing the broth in so you’re going to have the flavor of that veggies those veggies\n\nanyways yeah yeah um but it really helps us through these cold months to be\n\neating soup or even like drinking that broth regularly i have a recipe it’s more like a tip i think\n\nin the book but to to be drinking broth as a meal or in between meals it’s called warm liquid\n\ngold i saw that but you um you heat up the broth and then you you stir in some some fat of your\n\nchoice chicken fat or um coconut oil or olive oil or something put a little bit of sea salt\n\nyou could put cinnamon or something and just drink it and it’s nourishing and it coats your belly\n\nand it prepares you for what’s next you know i think it’s a nice thing to do it reminds me of a\n\nremedy that a dear friend in fact an old love of mine taught me which is to use chicken broth when\n\nwe’re getting sick and adding in cayenne and i think some black pepper yeah maybe some turmeric\n\nand a little bit of lemon juice and just drinking that and it’s it helps and so another great reason\n\nto keep some of this broth on hand right if we start to feel that tickle in the throat or we’re\n\nstarting to feel worn down it’s another excellent potential remedy we can go to yeah and uh\n\nyou’re you’re you’re what is it liquid gold what is it warm liquid gold warm liquid gold yeah i mean\n\nthis woman that i’m i’m working with currently i work with her on the phone coaching she lives\n\nback east and she works in jails every day and um she gets up really early and goes to jails and\n\nworks in jails every day and she drinks her broth before she goes to work every day and it’s like\n\nsaving her you know she that’s how she talks about it um and i think part of all of these practices\n\nwhether it’s making broth or drinking broth or slowing down to cook a meal um it’s self-care\n\nand um you may ask yourself like are you doing enough of that for yourself maybe you are\n\ni mean i’m not sometimes um sometimes i am but when i do that it’s in the act of doing it\n\nthat actually makes me feel more vital it gives me strength and makes me feel like\n\nmore fit you know i’m giving myself that message that i’m i’m worth this self nourishment yeah\n\nit’s so powerful yeah and it takes remembering and it takes doing and practicing it just like\n\nanything else yeah i love that yeah i love that yeah well Maria thank you so much
