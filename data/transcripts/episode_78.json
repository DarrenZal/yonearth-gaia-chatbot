20.9s]: in case you're wondering about the context.\n\n[21.2s - 22.0s]: Hope you enjoy.\n\n[22.9s - 25.2s]: Welcome to the Y Honors Community Podcast.\n\n[25.7s - 29.1s]: Today we are visiting with Maria Nicolcova.\n\n[29.1s - 29.8s]: Hi Maria.\n\n[30.0s - 30.7s]: Hello Erin.\n\n[30.9s - 31.4s]: Good to see you.\n\n[31.5s - 31.8s]: You too.\n\n[32.1s - 32.8s]: So nice to be here.\n\n[33.2s - 33.5s]: It's great.\n\n[33.7s - 37.5s]: We have this opportunity to speak with you and I'm really excited about what we'll be\n\n[37.5s - 38.6s]: talking about today.\n\n[39.2s - 41.2s]: Yeah, we have quite a bit to cover.\n\n[41.6s - 41.9s]: Indeed.\n\n[43.0s - 49.0s]: So I'll let our audience know that Maria Nicolcova started working in the molecular biology field\n\n[49.0s - 54.8s]: at the Miller Lab at the University of Colorado Denver as an undergraduate student receiving\n\n[54.8s - 60.0s]: the competitive undergraduate research opportunity program grant to support her work.\n\n[60.9s - 67.0s]: And after earning her Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2018 from CU Denver, she started\n\n[67.0s - 71.3s]: in the CU Denver Biology Master of Science program in the fall.\n\n[72.0s - 79.2s]: Currently, she is working on assembly, annotation, and interpretation of novel archeal genomes\n\n[79.2s - 85.0s]: from freshwater wetlands in the Miller Lab alongside collaborative in the right in\n\n[85.0s - 87.4s]: lab at Colorado State University.\n\n[88.5s - 94.9s]: So and Maria is also teaching at the University of Colorado both undergraduate and graduate\n\n[94.9s - 95.5s]: students.\n\n[96.1s - 99.9s]: And Maria, it's so cool to have this opportunity to talk with you a bit.\n\n[100.0s - 101.3s]: Today we're going to be covering some science.\n\n[101.5s - 103.5s]: Yeah, we're going to break down all that jargon.\n\n[103.5s - 105.1s]: You just mentioned in that last little bit.\n\n[105.4s - 105.8s]: It was great.\n\n[106.2s - 106.4s]: Thanks.\n\n[106.9s - 108.0s]: So where should we start?\n\n[108.9s - 113.9s]: We can just start right with the wetlands, right, with the archeal diversity.\n\n[114.8s - 120.5s]: That last sentence usually people's eyes kind of glaze over and they're kind of like,\n\n[120.6s - 121.1s]: what do you do?\n\n[121.3s - 122.2s]: I thought you were in biology.\n\n[122.3s - 125.5s]: What's with all this other mumbo jumbo?\n\n[127.5s - 132.9s]: So generally what I do right now is I do a lot of bioinformatics work.\n\n[133.2s - 134.6s]: So that's a lot of computer work.\n\n[135.2s - 140.9s]: I like to make the joke that I don't poke and prod squishy things even though I'm a biologist.\n\n[140.9s - 144.8s]: I do a lot of computational work, a lot of coding.\n\n[145.6s - 152.2s]: I see that black screen with the green font from the matrix much more often than I see\n\n[152.8s - 153.3s]: dead frogs.\n\n[153.6s - 153.9s]: Okay.\n\n[154.1s - 154.8s]: Let's put it that way.\n\n[155.3s - 155.3s]: \n\n[155.4s - 156.3s]: That paints a picture.\n\n[156.4s - 156.6s]: Yeah.\n\n[158.1s - 163.1s]: And so a lot of the, so the archeal, so they're a type of organism.\n\n[163.1s - 168.1s]: A microorganism that actually historically was always grouped together with bacteria.\n\n[168.4s - 171.0s]: They're usually single cell microorganisms.\n\n[172.1s - 174.0s]: And they're actually their own domain.\n\n[174.3s - 180.2s]: So if going back to kind of that basic biology we have three domains.\n\n[180.8s - 188.1s]: We have eukaryotes which is our cells, plant cells, all those fun squishy furry slimy things.\n\n[188.5s - 189.5s]: Are you carry out examples?\n\n[190.5s - 195.8s]: And then we have bacteria which unfortunately we usually hear in the negative term, you know,\n\n[195.9s - 202.7s]: all those ecoli and all those bad scary microbes that get a bad reputation but are kind of\n\n[202.7s - 203.5s]: all around us.\n\n[203.8s - 206.1s]: And then we have archaea.\n\n[206.7s - 213.2s]: So evolutionarily they were always put together until about the 1970s when a scientist called\n\n[213.2s - 218.4s]: Carl's woes made that really a phenomenal paper and he made that distinction showing\n\n[218.4s - 224.7s]: evolutionarily that really archaea are different from bacteria and from then on we've been\n\n[226.0s - 230.9s]: going forward at what I'd say is quite a fast pace.\n\n[231.3s - 239.0s]: And then within the last, really the field I mean got going much more quickly within the\n\n[239.0s - 243.9s]: 2000s right with the big technology boom because a lot of archaea they can't be grown\n\n[243.9s - 244.3s]: in a lab.\n\n[244.7s - 246.9s]: So a lot of bacteria you can grow in a lab.\n\n[246.9s - 249.4s]: You can see it on a petri dish, you can see it in a microscope.\n\n[250.1s - 251.6s]: You can't grow archaea.\n\n[251.8s - 257.6s]: They're so specific to their environment, they're so odd compared to even different kinds\n\n[257.6s - 260.9s]: of bacteria but they're fascinating.\n\n[261.4s - 266.6s]: They have these crazy metabolisms, sometimes some of the ones that I'm looking at they potentially\n\n[266.6s - 271.7s]: have hosts and we just don't know anything about them but there's this giant biodiversity\n\n[273.2s - 274.0s]: of things.\n\n[274.0s - 277.9s]: We just don't know about and it just boggles my mind.\n\n[278.1s - 279.6s]: So that's what I do.\n\n[280.2s - 286.5s]: One of the things that I find absolutely astounding as a non-technical person, understanding\n\n[286.5s - 293.6s]: more and more the importance of the microbiome and soil in our own bodies, there's really\n\n[293.6s - 302.2s]: this explosion of knowledge and understanding just in the last few decades and yet we still\n\n[302.2s - 309.4s]: hardly understand these complex critters and systems that ultimately are essential to\n\n[309.4s - 311.1s]: the fabric of life on the planet, right?\n\n[311.5s - 311.6s]: Right.\n\n[312.2s - 319.2s]: So what's interesting especially about archaea, generally, is that the studies that started\n\n[319.2s - 322.1s]: with them were actually in these extreme environments.\n\n[322.3s - 328.1s]: So that's one of the first kinds of archaea we see are these extreme files as people like\n\n[328.1s - 328.6s]: to call them.\n\n[328.7s - 335.8s]: So they lived in super salty environments or deep, deep ocean in places with lots of\n\n[335.8s - 338.6s]: sulfur and hot places like Yellowstone.\n\n[339.5s - 345.5s]: And then for quite a bit we thought, oh, okay, there are just these extreme organisms that\n\n[345.5s - 352.5s]: live in these extreme environments but back to what you were mentioning is that the work\n\n[352.5s - 354.3s]: we do is in wetlands.\n\n[354.9s - 357.6s]: That's not an extreme environment in any sense of the word.\n\n[357.8s - 364.1s]: It's not super moist, it's not super dry, it's just kind of a meh environment.\n\n[364.4s - 367.7s]: You know, it's not super salty, it's usually pretty temperate.\n\n[368.0s - 372.1s]: So the wetland we work in is a temperate wetland so there is no salt.\n\n[373.3s - 378.8s]: It's the same type of plant cover, you know, there's not really particularly anything special\n\n[378.8s - 379.4s]: about it.\n\n[379.4s - 382.4s]: But we see this mass diversity.\n\n[384.1s - 390.7s]: So just even with that, how we see, you know, like that sequencing boom, that DNA sequencing\n\n[390.7s - 396.8s]: boom has really allowed us to go further than just these extreme environments and get more\n\n[396.8s - 400.7s]: into depth into environments we never thought would even have this kind of diversity.\n\n[401.1s - 403.0s]: And even that is still being uncovered.\n\n[403.0s - 410.8s]: So specifically, at least for the small amount of archaea that I'm looking at, I'm looking\n\n[410.8s - 411.8s]: at a file in level.\n\n[411.9s - 414.5s]: A file in level is the next down from domain.\n\n[414.8s - 417.7s]: So that's, you know, if it's like, oh, what do you do?\n\n[418.0s - 418.7s]: What is this?\n\n[419.1s - 423.5s]: Like, well, you have to even know what an elephant is to start describing it, right?\n\n[423.8s - 427.3s]: And so there's these elephants in wetlands that we can't describe.\n\n[427.6s - 428.5s]: We don't even know what they are.\n\n[428.5s - 433.2s]: Like, how do you describe an elephant to someone when they don't even have the concept\n\n[433.2s - 433.9s]: of an elephant?\n\n[434.4s - 434.7s]: Right.\n\n[435.1s - 435.3s]: Okay.\n\n[435.4s - 436.0s]: So this is interesting.\n\n[436.2s - 437.4s]: So we're talking about phylum.\n\n[438.0s - 441.4s]: I remember this king phylum, something or other from school.\n\n[442.9s - 447.7s]: And we're saying are these domains the same as like kingdoms that we were taught about\n\n[447.7s - 448.7s]: or is that a little bit different?\n\n[449.0s - 449.4s]: Oh, yes.\n\n[449.6s - 451.6s]: So you'll have your kingdom and domain.\n\n[451.7s - 455.1s]: So those are the three main kingdoms or three main domains.\n\n[455.8s - 459.7s]: And then after that, you get phylum and then your king philope.\n\n[460.0s - 462.8s]: I think I know which one you're talking about.\n\n[463.2s - 463.2s]: What was it?\n\n[463.3s - 463.8s]: Yeah, I don't even know either.\n\n[463.9s - 467.3s]: King philope came over for Good Spaghetti.\n\n[467.6s - 467.9s]: Is that it?\n\n[468.0s - 468.4s]: Yes, seven.\n\n[468.6s - 471.6s]: So you have your seven taxonomic taxonomy levels.\n\n[471.8s - 472.1s]: Okay.\n\n[472.6s - 474.4s]: And that found little bit.\n\n[475.3s - 480.9s]: And a lot of microbial research actually focuses on those bottom two.\n\n[481.2s - 484.4s]: But Good Spaghetti, the genus and species.\n\n[484.4s - 490.6s]: So a common one, E coli, E genus coli species.\n\n[492.0s - 496.1s]: Archaea, a lot of it, we don't know down to the genus and species.\n\n[496.4s - 502.1s]: We have domain, so we have Archaea and then the one right after phylum.\n\n[503.0s - 505.5s]: We don't even know genus and species.\n\n[505.7s - 512.7s]: We barely, we can't even classify most of the things that at least I'm looking at down\n\n[512.7s - 516.0s]: to a class level, which is a major grouping.\n\n[517.3s - 519.8s]: It's almost like saying all mushrooms.\n\n[520.4s - 521.2s]: Wow, right.\n\n[522.6s - 523.3s]: That's crazy.\n\n[523.6s - 524.1s]: Yeah, yeah.\n\n[524.2s - 528.7s]: So what does Archaea matter?\n\n[528.9s - 532.8s]: What does it have to do with our day to day lives and how is it potentially important\n\n[532.8s - 538.3s]: to some of these major systemic challenges we're facing as a global society, whether\n\n[538.3s - 541.9s]: it's pollution or climate change or what have you like, how does it all kind of connect\n\n[541.9s - 544.7s]: up to these issues that most of us would be familiar with?\n\n[545.5s - 550.0s]: So a big part of that connection is going to be soil, right?\n\n[550.6s - 552.1s]: Soil is going to connect all of us.\n\n[552.3s - 554.9s]: Whether you like it or not, you interact with soil daily.\n\n[555.2s - 560.4s]: Even if you walk on concrete, if you only walk on concrete, that's a derivative of soil.\n\n[561.0s - 561.8s]: You're walking on soil.\n\n[562.0s - 564.8s]: Or that concrete has interacted with the soil.\n\n[565.1s - 567.1s]: It's interacted with that microbial community.\n\n[567.4s - 568.4s]: That's in that soil.\n\n[569.2s - 574.3s]: Everyone on Earth, even if you live in a submarine, is interacting with soil because\n\n[574.3s - 575.4s]: what's underneath that water?\n\n[576.0s - 576.4s]: Soil.\n\n[578.3s - 580.8s]: So, that's going to be my mainframe.\n\n[581.0s - 582.0s]: Is that soil bit?\n\n[583.6s - 589.4s]: And where that connection comes in is that each soil environment, how you mentioned that\n\n[589.4s - 590.6s]: like gut microbiome.\n\n[591.0s - 593.5s]: Each soil environment has its own microbiome in a sense.\n\n[593.9s - 595.4s]: It has its own microbial communities.\n\n[595.6s - 597.7s]: It has its own microbial niches.\n\n[597.7s - 601.8s]: So, it's just in a sense, it's like a rainforest, right?\n\n[602.0s - 607.3s]: You can't just take a single tree of a rainforest and say, oh, I now understand the rainforest\n\n[607.3s - 611.2s]: because I understand this single orchid that lives in this single tree.\n\n[611.4s - 615.5s]: And I can understand the whole ecosystem of the rainforest.\n\n[616.2s - 621.6s]: Microbial communities are just as complex, if not more complex, with their metabolism.\n\n[621.6s - 630.6s]: Because microbes do things like nitrogen cycling that we rely on.\n\n[630.9s - 637.1s]: And there are some of the only ones that convert, let's say, elemental forms of nitrogen\n\n[638.3s - 639.7s]: to something that we can use.\n\n[639.8s - 643.1s]: So, we like to use any periodic cells and other types of organisms.\n\n[643.1s - 645.8s]: We like to use usually ammonium.\n\n[646.2s - 647.3s]: That's a form of nitrogen.\n\n[649.0s - 655.8s]: But, at my spirit nitrogen, so, in general, chemistry, it's N with the subscript of 2,\n\n[656.4s - 660.4s]: just that gaseous form of nitrogen, we can't do anything with that.\n\n[661.2s - 665.6s]: So even if there was an abundance, and if there's an abundance of all this nitrogen, we can't\n\n[665.6s - 666.4s]: do anything with it.\n\n[666.5s - 668.8s]: It's not ammonium, it's not in a form that we can use.\n\n[669.7s - 674.4s]: And microbes can use that, and they can convert it to these different forms of nitrogen,\n\n[674.4s - 682.5s]: nitrate, and nitrite, and all these other, you know, ending products that other kinds\n\n[682.5s - 683.4s]: of cells can use.\n\n[684.0s - 690.8s]: And so, where I'm going to kind of more dive deep into the white wetlands and all that.\n\n[691.3s - 695.5s]: So, tempered freshwater wetlands are actually the largest source of naturally-emitting methane.\n\n[696.9s - 701.1s]: And which is a very powerful greenhouse gas, which is, and I believe it will be powerful\n\n[701.1s - 706.1s]: greenhouse gas, that we usually don't associate with wetlands.\n\n[706.6s - 709.4s]: It's a lot of the times it's associated with production and everything.\n\n[710.4s - 720.9s]: And the thing is, when we make models for, let's say, methane emission, we need to account\n\n[720.9s - 722.3s]: for that natural methane as well.\n\n[723.1s - 726.8s]: Yes, we have that industrial methane, but we also have that natural methane.\n\n[726.8s - 732.1s]: And to create an accurate model, so we can actually create accurate mathematical models,\n\n[732.1s - 739.2s]: and then create potentially plants on how to regulate it, and potentially where we can build,\n\n[739.7s - 745.1s]: and what we can be around in that regard, we need that accurate information.\n\n[745.5s - 748.9s]: And a lot of that methane is coming from microbes.\n\n[750.5s - 756.0s]: And then what's diving deeper down is that biodiversity aspect is,\n\n[758.4s - 761.2s]: we're losing a lot of biodiversity, and we hear that every day,\n\n[761.8s - 765.1s]: but we hear that in what I think is a grander scheme of things.\n\n[765.2s - 769.2s]: This is when we hear about larger organisms, so we hear frogs, we hear mushrooms,\n\n[769.6s - 771.6s]: we hear all these sad things.\n\n[772.2s - 777.7s]: But in that regard, microbes are being lost just as quickly, but we don't know about it.\n\n[777.7s - 783.1s]: We don't know about many of the species that we're losing that we can see without a microscope.\n\n[784.2s - 789.3s]: It's hard to make people care about something, not only can you not even see it under a microscope,\n\n[789.3s - 792.7s]: you can only see it in your computer with DNA sequencing.\n\n[793.4s - 799.6s]: So that's kind of the larger, funneled pictures going from soil that affects us all,\n\n[799.8s - 804.7s]: all the way down to these microbes that have actually enormous potential for all\n\n[804.7s - 808.6s]: of our methane cycling, our nitrogen cycling, our carbon cycling,\n\n[809.3s - 815.0s]: really all those big, big words when we talk about environments,\n\n[815.2s - 822.7s]: and we talk about methane emission and carbon emission and all these issues that we're having.\n\n[823.0s - 823.1s]: Yes.\n\n[823.8s - 825.9s]: They're all in interlaced with microbes.\n\n[827.1s - 830.1s]: So I'm so curious because with the Y-Earth community,\n\n[830.1s - 836.0s]: one of the things we've done a lot with strategically is helping people connect the dots\n\n[836.0s - 843.4s]: both mentally and viscerally to the soil and talk about the soil microbiome and how important it is.\n\n[843.5s - 844.8s]: But we can't see it.\n\n[844.9s - 850.0s]: And one of the things that boggles my mind is this issue of orders of magnitude and size differences.\n\n[850.9s - 858.2s]: And do you have any way of helping to explain how small some of these organisms actually are?\n\n[858.2s - 861.2s]: Is there a way to paint that picture for people?\n\n[863.8s - 871.4s]: I would say to some of the smaller microbes, which like I said,\n\n[871.6s - 873.5s]: we can't grow and everything.\n\n[873.7s - 880.6s]: It almost be like the difference between the tip of a pin and the size of all of earth.\n\n[881.5s - 882.8s]: That's a stounding...\n\n[882.8s - 884.5s]: That's boggling, right?\n\n[884.8s - 885.0s]: Yes.\n\n[885.0s - 887.8s]: It's not even the difference between a baseball and a basketball.\n\n[888.5s - 888.8s]: Right. Right.\n\n[889.1s - 891.1s]: That can be that much of a difference.\n\n[891.7s - 892.9s]: That's really incredible.\n\n[893.0s - 899.0s]: And I remember hearing that just blew my mind and it may have been more with the bacteria side of things,\n\n[899.1s - 907.9s]: but that within the microbiome, there are organisms that are thousands of times larger than other organisms,\n\n[908.2s - 910.1s]: all of which are invisible to our eyes.\n\n[910.1s - 917.5s]: Right. So there's this whole universe of living critters that we cannot see without the aid of technology, right?\n\n[918.0s - 924.8s]: Yeah. So that is a lot of what we've been able to do to with that sequencing.\n\n[926.4s - 930.3s]: So a lot of those critters, I really like that word, and enjoy that.\n\n[930.7s - 935.3s]: So a lot of the critters that you mentioned, even if let's say they're big or small,\n\n[936.7s - 938.6s]: some of them just, you can't even grow.\n\n[939.2s - 944.4s]: Like, it doesn't matter. Even if it's a big, if it's something big that we could see under a microscope,\n\n[944.9s - 946.6s]: maybe it doesn't want to grow a lab.\n\n[947.1s - 948.7s]: We can't grow it a lab.\n\n[949.2s - 955.6s]: And so that's where that issue comes in with trying to determine also, let's say the biodiversity of your gut,\n\n[956.1s - 957.5s]: or the biodiversity.\n\n[959.3s - 960.8s]: Everything has a biodiversity, right?\n\n[960.8s - 965.8s]: So like the microbiome of your inner elbows is going to be different than the microbiome of the top of your hand.\n\n[967.3s - 969.8s]: So just because of that difference, right?\n\n[970.0s - 974.2s]: So let's say like your inner elbow gets probably exposed less to air than the top of your hand.\n\n[974.5s - 978.2s]: So already there's that difference in microbial composition.\n\n[979.7s - 986.7s]: But if I were to take a swab, let's say of my hand, and I was to dry and grow it on a petri dish,\n\n[987.6s - 990.3s]: and we call it like an all-medium.\n\n[990.6s - 993.0s]: So something that accounts for at least most of the nutrients.\n\n[993.7s - 998.1s]: Again, that's going to be only conducive to organisms that can grow in a lab.\n\n[998.4s - 1002.9s]: So there might be organisms on there that I don't know what they're like just because they're not growing,\n\n[1003.4s - 1007.2s]: because they don't have them proper conditions, and you'll never find a medium.\n\n[1007.8s - 1011.7s]: That's not all medium. Like we call it all-medium, but it's not.\n\n[1012.6s - 1014.2s]: It's not going to encompass everything.\n\n[1014.6s - 1016.2s]: So you have to make adjustments for that.\n\n[1016.9s - 1022.0s]: So what sequencing, that DNA sequencing has a lot to do is kind of in environment,\n\n[1022.2s - 1027.9s]: is to, in a sense, take that swab and then from that environment just sequence out all the DNA.\n\n[1028.5s - 1029.2s]: Oh, interesting.\n\n[1029.6s - 1035.8s]: And so you can get a better picture of something just because even if it's not growing,\n\n[1036.5s - 1038.2s]: you might be able to see it in your computer.\n\n[1038.2s - 1043.0s]: You're like, oh, that's weird. That's the, there's this chunk of DNA or this, this genome.\n\n[1043.3s - 1047.8s]: So the genome is all the DNA that makes us up.\n\n[1048.1s - 1049.5s]: Or the mix up ourselves.\n\n[1050.0s - 1052.9s]: It makes us all so. It's all that genetic code.\n\n[1054.5s - 1060.5s]: And so you might see something like, oh, this doesn't relate to any of the other large critters that we have,\n\n[1060.7s - 1064.9s]: or that we've been able to grow, but they're here. So something is here.\n\n[1064.9s - 1070.1s]: How do you know if you're looking at genetic sequences,\n\n[1070.7s - 1075.1s]: how do you know that like this sequence over here belongs to some,\n\n[1076.5s - 1078.1s]: what's the word I'm looking for?\n\n[1079.3s - 1080.2s]: Archaia, is that right?\n\n[1080.6s - 1080.8s]: Yeah.\n\n[1081.8s - 1085.3s]: Versus it's part of a gene of a large organism.\n\n[1085.8s - 1089.0s]: Like how do you even know what it is you're looking at and like,\n\n[1089.3s - 1092.3s]: where it belongs in that organization of biology?\n\n[1093.3s - 1096.2s]: A lot of the answer is going to be we don't.\n\n[1097.7s - 1105.0s]: So we have references for a lot of the sequencing started with things we did now.\n\n[1105.4s - 1106.3s]: So we sequence that.\n\n[1106.7s - 1109.1s]: Like, okay, we're pretty sure of this genome.\n\n[1109.7s - 1111.8s]: That's very cool. I like to use a colas.\n\n[1111.8s - 1116.4s]: An example, because most people have at least, if not negatively heard about it.\n\n[1116.6s - 1116.8s]: Right.\n\n[1117.5s - 1121.2s]: So we generally know the DNA sequence of E-cola.\n\n[1121.2s - 1127.0s]: And so from there, you can kind of go, okay,\n\n[1127.3s - 1129.5s]: so we have these other things that we've grown in the lab,\n\n[1129.5s - 1131.1s]: and we have the genetic sequence for those.\n\n[1131.6s - 1134.5s]: And then we have something else that we don't know yet.\n\n[1134.8s - 1137.3s]: And you know, you just kind of put a question mark around it.\n\n[1137.4s - 1137.7s]: Interesting.\n\n[1138.0s - 1138.6s]: That's interesting.\n\n[1138.9s - 1142.2s]: And so it is kind of a game of Tetris in that regard.\n\n[1142.4s - 1142.5s]: Cool.\n\n[1142.6s - 1145.5s]: So you're trying to piece it together and get that row.\n\n[1146.4s - 1147.8s]: It's like a massive puzzle.\n\n[1148.1s - 1149.2s]: It's a massive puzzle.\n\n[1149.2s - 1153.6s]: And the thing is for, especially archaeal research,\n\n[1154.1s - 1158.8s]: it's that tree, so if you like, like a phylogenetic tree,\n\n[1159.0s - 1165.7s]: so that tree that separates bacteria in one branch and us in another branch,\n\n[1165.7s - 1169.4s]: and archaeine in another branch, and it's all kind of together.\n\n[1170.5s - 1171.9s]: Those are changing.\n\n[1172.6s - 1175.4s]: It's not a static structure.\n\n[1176.9s - 1182.2s]: So you know, you might have a research paper that comes out and says,\n\n[1182.6s - 1188.4s]: oh, this archaea, I work with Enigma Archaeotus,\n\n[1189.2s - 1192.0s]: I'm just going to say that one, yeah, it's an enigma,\n\n[1192.0s - 1193.5s]: because we don't know anything about it.\n\n[1194.0s - 1194.5s]: It's a phylum.\n\n[1195.0s - 1195.0s]: Yeah.\n\n[1196.2s - 1200.0s]: So it's a phylum, and let's say a paper comes out and says,\n\n[1200.5s - 1203.6s]: it has to be within this branch and in this branch.\n\n[1203.6s - 1209.1s]: So it gives it a set area for it to be in.\n\n[1209.5s - 1211.6s]: And then I sequence some things.\n\n[1212.1s - 1217.9s]: I use some computational methods and some statistical models.\n\n[1218.3s - 1221.9s]: And I look at their model and I say, I don't agree.\n\n[1222.5s - 1224.4s]: I don't think it does belong here.\n\n[1224.5s - 1230.6s]: I think, you know, it could be here or here.\n\n[1230.6s - 1234.9s]: So everything is also for something like that you can't grow,\n\n[1235.2s - 1236.9s]: and something that you're not sure of.\n\n[1237.1s - 1238.4s]: It's also based on statistics.\n\n[1239.3s - 1244.3s]: So some statistical models are going to be more sure or less sure.\n\n[1244.5s - 1246.7s]: So there's always a percentage associated with it,\n\n[1246.9s - 1248.8s]: which I think scientists get a bad rap for,\n\n[1248.9s - 1250.4s]: because you'll never hear a scientist say,\n\n[1250.5s - 1253.8s]: I'm 100% sure that this is the truth.\n\n[1254.5s - 1256.3s]: You're the R-squared problem, basically.\n\n[1256.3s - 1256.6s]: Right.\n\n[1258.5s - 1262.8s]: So I think that also is a big part of it,\n\n[1263.0s - 1267.7s]: is that how much do you trust your statistical model?\n\n[1267.8s - 1268.8s]: And we run a lot of them.\n\n[1269.0s - 1271.5s]: You know, we don't run just one and say, yeah, we're good to go.\n\n[1271.6s - 1273.9s]: Let's, let's head out and publish this paper.\n\n[1275.1s - 1284.6s]: We run quite a few, and then whatever statistical model best suits that tree.\n\n[1284.6s - 1285.4s]: Mm-hmm.\n\n[1285.9s - 1287.6s]: Is what we'll take into consideration.\n\n[1287.9s - 1290.9s]: Again, it's not, it might not be publishably, I think,\n\n[1291.4s - 1292.8s]: but we're taking it into consideration.\n\n[1293.3s - 1299.6s]: So there's a lot of stepwise process that comes between us making something in the lab\n\n[1299.6s - 1301.4s]: or us doing something in the lab.\n\n[1301.9s - 1305.7s]: And it going out into a published research paper.\n\n[1306.6s - 1309.2s]: So there's quite a few steps in between there.\n\n[1310.1s - 1313.1s]: And there's also reviews and peer reviews.\n\n[1313.1s - 1318.5s]: And there's quite a few steps that try to account for those errors.\n\n[1319.0s - 1319.4s]: Interesting.\n\n[1319.6s - 1324.6s]: Yeah, it sounds like it's a very sophisticated and well-defined process,\n\n[1325.0s - 1329.0s]: regarding things that are very difficult to understand,\n\n[1329.7s - 1333.5s]: things that a few decades ago we hardly even knew existed.\n\n[1334.4s - 1339.8s]: And here they are absolutely affecting our lives as human beings on the planet,\n\n[1339.8s - 1342.5s]: dealing with these issues that we're dealing with, right?\n\n[1342.7s - 1348.7s]: And to continue to tie this discussion back, I'm so struck by in our culture,\n\n[1349.1s - 1353.9s]: there can be this incredible gap between folks who work in the sciences\n\n[1353.9s - 1357.0s]: and or have friends who work in the sciences,\n\n[1357.2s - 1360.1s]: and at least have some appreciation for those procedures\n\n[1360.1s - 1362.8s]: and how that body of knowledge is developed.\n\n[1363.3s - 1367.1s]: And then there are a lot of us who don't have any familiarity with science\n\n[1367.1s - 1372.0s]: and perhaps moreover how to negative experience back in ninth grade or whatever.\n\n[1372.4s - 1374.5s]: And it's not a comfortable territory.\n\n[1374.5s - 1379.2s]: And I think it's really interesting to explore how do we attempt to communicate\n\n[1379.2s - 1384.9s]: from a highly technical and credibly mathematically-based way of understanding knowledge\n\n[1384.9s - 1391.6s]: to folks for whom those maybe aren't as well developed or easily acquired\n\n[1391.6s - 1393.5s]: as a set of skills, right?\n\n[1393.5s - 1396.7s]: And I'm struck that you use visualization a lot.\n\n[1396.7s - 1400.2s]: I know I want to make sure to ask you about that, but go ahead.\n\n[1400.3s - 1403.5s]: Yeah, just it's funny that you mentioned that high school example.\n\n[1404.0s - 1409.9s]: In high school one of my biology teachers said I was really worried about human biology.\n\n[1410.2s - 1411.5s]: I don't think you'll make it as a biology.\n\n[1411.7s - 1413.1s]: Or maybe you should do something else.\n\n[1413.3s - 1414.0s]: That's your own.\n\n[1414.3s - 1416.8s]: That was an exact actual example.\n\n[1417.0s - 1418.9s]: And I'm going to show you.\n\n[1419.7s - 1420.4s]: I love that.\n\n[1420.4s - 1426.4s]: So I definitely can see where people are coming from that because I have definitely had that experience\n\n[1426.4s - 1428.8s]: where the teacher was like, nope.\n\n[1429.2s - 1431.5s]: I don't think you're going to do greatness field.\n\n[1431.9s - 1434.2s]: Or maybe you should pursue something else.\n\n[1434.3s - 1436.1s]: Have you tried the literary department?\n\n[1436.7s - 1438.2s]: I kind of know.\n\n[1438.2s - 1438.6s]: Oh, no.\n\n[1439.1s - 1440.2s]: Well, rough.\n\n[1440.8s - 1441.7s]: Kind of.\n\n[1443.0s - 1448.9s]: So I think when you mentioned visualization, that's why I like to use visualization so much.\n\n[1449.6s - 1451.4s]: I'm very much a visual person.\n\n[1451.7s - 1454.2s]: I am in no way a computer person.\n\n[1455.1s - 1456.4s]: That is not me.\n\n[1457.6s - 1458.9s]: That is my big brother.\n\n[1459.4s - 1462.1s]: He was always much more the computer person.\n\n[1462.3s - 1462.5s]: Big brother.\n\n[1462.8s - 1463.8s]: Yeah, the big brother.\n\n[1464.0s - 1465.3s]: Big brother, Artem Nikolikov.\n\n[1465.4s - 1466.4s]: He's here in the room with us.\n\n[1466.5s - 1467.3s]: Actually off camera.\n\n[1467.6s - 1468.7s]: This is a quick shout out.\n\n[1468.7s - 1468.8s]: Yeah.\n\n[1469.6s - 1470.5s]: Hi everyone.\n\n[1471.7s - 1472.4s]: That's great.\n\n[1472.7s - 1478.4s]: But, you know, he was always kind of more the technical, more the computer and everything.\n\n[1479.4s - 1482.9s]: And the person that you go to, you're like, my computer is broken.\n\n[1483.4s - 1483.6s]: Yeah.\n\n[1484.9s - 1486.3s]: I was never in that.\n\n[1488.4s - 1493.2s]: I was never in that real technical mindset.\n\n[1495.3s - 1503.6s]: But there's something to be said that science is a lot of creativity too.\n\n[1503.6s - 1503.9s]: Yeah.\n\n[1505.1s - 1520.3s]: And which actually that's one of the things I started to enjoy about science is that once I started to kind of get more into science and see some of these interesting things that we're just coming out of news articles.\n\n[1523.2s - 1526.3s]: Some of the best things that I learned were from visualizations.\n\n[1526.3s - 1530.6s]: Like a very well-defined 3D model or something.\n\n[1531.2s - 1541.0s]: Because I didn't, you know, I couldn't bridge through that three and a half paragraphs of equations or formulas or just made my eyes crossed.\n\n[1541.4s - 1543.3s]: I think I need to do something else.\n\n[1543.9s - 1556.1s]: So that's part of what I like to do in terms of visualization is and trying to come up with metaphors that sometimes work sometimes don't.\n\n[1556.1s - 1560.2s]: And so I think that's the four trying to imagine these things.\n\n[1561.0s - 1563.7s]: How do you imagine something you don't know how to imagine?\n\n[1564.5s - 1567.1s]: That's such an interesting question that's almost like a co-on.\n\n[1567.3s - 1567.4s]: Yeah.\n\n[1567.9s - 1580.7s]: Well, and I know from our previous conversations that in addition to all the work you're doing in biology and with science and with computer modeling, you're also an artist and a drawer.\n\n[1580.7s - 1585.4s]: And according to Artim, we'll let Artim say it, an illustrate corner.\n\n[1586.3s - 1592.0s]: And probably give it an entire artist in the true sense of the word.\n\n[1593.3s - 1596.1s]: I appreciate the vote of confidence.\n\n[1597.4s - 1598.3s]: I don't know.\n\n[1598.5s - 1609.5s]: I think it's a good well-rounded way to get away from those statistics from those computers.\n\n[1609.5s - 1618.6s]: And to do something that just seems odd almost at times, even though drawing comes more naturally to me than computers.\n\n[1618.6s - 1622.7s]: At this point, I'm with computers so much that it's almost going back to drawing.\n\n[1622.7s - 1623.9s]: Sometimes it feels odd.\n\n[1624.1s - 1626.2s]: Like, what do I do here?\n\n[1626.5s - 1626.6s]: What do I do?\n\n[1626.6s - 1627.3s]: It's an interesting question.\n\n[1627.3s - 1627.3s]: \n\n[1627.6s - 1629.0s]: So it's that different mindset.\n\n[1629.7s - 1638.9s]: And sometimes that kind of almost meditative drawing bit has helped me.\n\n[1638.9s - 1641.8s]: Oh, yeah, that's why my computer code didn't work.\n\n[1642.0s - 1643.9s]: And then I'll rush back to my computer.\n\n[1644.8s - 1646.1s]: I love that.\n\n[1646.3s - 1646.7s]: I love that.\n\n[1646.7s - 1656.1s]: As a writer, I've experienced that where if I'm painting or drawing or even sometimes cooking insights, it seems like certain thoughts will crystallize.\n\n[1656.3s - 1665.1s]: And it seems that having some balance in different activities probably helps us in our primary area of focus in ways perhaps that isn't always obvious.\n\n[1665.1s - 1671.4s]: I always liked, I think it was that Roman model of the perfect soldier.\n\n[1671.8s - 1673.5s]: It was a triangle.\n\n[1674.3s - 1682.5s]: And the top of the triangle was like athleticism and the physicality of it.\n\n[1683.5s - 1690.3s]: One of the sides of the triangle was, one of the points was intellectualism and reading and all that.\n\n[1690.7s - 1693.3s]: And the other side was more of that creativity aspect.\n\n[1693.3s - 1700.4s]: And so that made almost like a perfect Roman soldier because he would be able to be creative and both athletic and intellectual.\n\n[1701.3s - 1719.2s]: And I don't know, I kind of liked that model too is, you know, you can't, if you're too heavy on one side, you kind of start to tip over or you get so narrow, narrowly into it, that it's kind of hard to see all around you.\n\n[1719.2s - 1725.7s]: So I've met some brilliant peoples and they were so smart.\n\n[1725.9s - 1732.5s]: I mean, just unbelievably smart with statistics and math and everything.\n\n[1732.9s - 1734.4s]: But it was just so narrow.\n\n[1735.0s - 1741.4s]: And I'm like, I just, I need that extra conversation because I like things outside of science.\n\n[1741.8s - 1747.8s]: Yes, I, right now I consider myself a scientist, which is also still a little odd for me.\n\n[1747.8s - 1750.8s]: And if I was going to be doing like, oh, I'm still a student scientist.\n\n[1751.1s - 1756.7s]: I don't know what I do. I just exist in this, in this world of soil.\n\n[1760.2s - 1765.6s]: But having that more rounded aspect really helps and ground me.\n\n[1766.5s - 1768.7s]: Yeah. That's really beautiful.\n\n[1768.7s - 1773.9s]: Well, let me just take a moment to remind our audience that this is the Wieners Community podcast.\n\n[1774.4s - 1784.2s]: And today I am visiting with Maria Nicolkolba, who is sister's, sister of Adam Nicolkov, who's also in the room here with us.\n\n[1784.2s - 1797.8s]: And it's a great segue and opportunity to thank our supporters who include Earth Coast Productions, Adam's company, the Lidge Family Foundation, Patagonia, Purium.\n\n[1797.8s - 1806.6s]: And Walea Waters. And also want to give a huge shout out to all of the folks who have joined our Wienerth Monthly Giving program.\n\n[1807.3s - 1811.2s]: And if you haven't yet joined and you'd like to, you can join at any level you want to.\n\n[1811.2s - 1818.2s]: You just go to Wienerth.org slash support. And you can set that up nice and easy and straightforward.\n\n[1818.2s - 1824.8s]: And also want to let you know about a very special program we have with one of our social enterprise sponsors, Walea Waters.\n\n[1825.5s - 1839.7s]: If you want to join the monthly giving program at certain levels, $33, $88 or $133, you'll get monthly shipments of the Walea Waters hemp infused soaking salts.\n\n[1840.4s - 1849.4s]: And you can find more information about that at Wienerth.org slash Walea. That's W-E-Waters. Water with an S at the end.\n\n[1849.4s - 1864.5s]: And thanks to everybody for your support for making this podcast series possible and for supporting all of our community mobilization work for climate action, soil regeneration and cultural healing.\n\n[1865.3s - 1879.4s]: And so excited about the projects we've got underway this year. And Maria, it's such a joy to have the opportunity to sort of peek behind the curtain as to what's going on in the sciences right now.\n\n[1879.4s - 1887.0s]: Around microbiome and what we know what we don't know what we know we don't know and what we don't know we don't know right.\n\n[1887.2s - 1900.4s]: I love that that arrangement of sort of our knowledge structure. And I'm just wondering when you're working with wetlands and you're thinking about something like climate change.\n\n[1900.4s - 1919.6s]: What would your sense like if you're to if you were to speak to a university assembly of folks who can do things about climate change, how might wetlands play into this and what might we do differently as society that would help us with this challenge.\n\n[1920.6s - 1930.9s]: So part of wetlands what I think is fascinating is that we have a terrible history of dredging them up because they're useless quote unquote right.\n\n[1931.4s - 1938.8s]: Like I said, they're not an extremely hot environment, they're not an extremely cold environment, they're kind of easy to dredge out.\n\n[1939.3s - 1951.1s]: And we have all the possibilities to do so. And we have for quite a bit of time actually, if you think about, you know, New York or Seattle or everything.\n\n[1951.5s - 1960.4s]: A lot of those places were either like ocean and then as you go further in it's wetland.\n\n[1960.4s - 1974.2s]: And so a lot of these cities have had to, you know, have these pumping systems and all these crazy mechanisms to basically get rid of something that was already naturally there.\n\n[1975.2s - 1978.5s]: I mean, don't get me wrong. I love New York.\n\n[1979.7s - 1984.2s]: It's a fun place. My brother and I visited Seattle. Seattle was lovely.\n\n[1984.2s - 1991.0s]: I don't want to talk about the cities. It's just that history of what we've been kind of doing with wetlands.\n\n[1994.4s - 1998.3s]: And what now is happening with wetlands is that we still kind of do that.\n\n[1998.6s - 2011.5s]: You know, they don't get as much attention as some of the other, you know, being beautiful parts of nature that we have say our mountains are beautiful.\n\n[2011.5s - 2013.8s]: There's snow catch, they're picturesque.\n\n[2014.2s - 2020.8s]: Wetlands can be picturesque, but maybe not as much as a snow capped mountain for a postcard.\n\n[2021.7s - 2033.1s]: So I think there's that aspect of biodiversity that not all important things are going to be the most beautiful things.\n\n[2033.4s - 2035.3s]: Yeah, that's such an important message.\n\n[2036.3s - 2043.1s]: So, and wetlands, I think, really fall into that category. I think wetlands can be very beautiful.\n\n[2043.5s - 2050.5s]: It's just sometimes they kind of get fallen onto the wayside compared to some of the other things.\n\n[2051.6s - 2065.1s]: Oh, interesting. So it sounds like we should consider further protecting the wetlands and perhaps even in some places doing what we can to restore what it's been drained or dredged or whatever.\n\n[2065.8s - 2074.5s]: It's interesting because a lot of our historical development as a species has been a major river estuaries, right?\n\n[2074.7s - 2078.5s]: We used to do most of our travel and shipping by sea by water.\n\n[2079.2s - 2087.0s]: And it would make sense that we would have these major settlements at the mouths of rivers and so forth, but that turns out these are also where wetlands are located, right?\n\n[2087.4s - 2092.9s]: Right. And I don't think, you know, completely getting rid of settlements from around there.\n\n[2093.9s - 2103.0s]: All of this ultimately, when I think about at least climate change and all these people doing these wonderful work and everything,\n\n[2104.4s - 2113.7s]: all of that I think has to culminate with us not dredging up and concreting and paving the earth, right?\n\n[2113.7s - 2131.9s]: You can pave parts, but leave some parts unpaved. It's all going to come to, I want to say like an ecosystem where we have to have a certain harmony as almost clichés that sounds right now, which is another thing.\n\n[2132.1s - 2137.2s]: I think it's odd that you know, clichés, some of them are there for a reason, but harmony is harmony.\n\n[2137.2s - 2153.4s]: It's a wonderful world that we've been kind of overusing to mean certain different things, but yeah, I think part of that, so how you mentioned that we used the mouths of rivers for transporting things.\n\n[2154.0s - 2165.7s]: I don't see why we can leave that river there. We can still live around it. We can still have big green spaces. We can have the natural wetland that's there.\n\n[2165.7s - 2175.1s]: So instead of you know, dredging up even like say a wetland and putting a park there. Just leave that wetland there.\n\n[2175.2s - 2188.0s]: Leave it as it is. Yeah, that's really brilliant. So I want to make sure to hit on something that you shared before we started recording that excites me because it's just so far beyond my technical expertise.\n\n[2188.0s - 2197.9s]: And it's this thing called CRISPR and I thought it would be fun just to share a little with the audience about some of the highly technical stuff that you're engaged in.\n\n[2198.5s - 2204.3s]: And so can you tell us what's CRISPR and what is it stand for and why is it important?\n\n[2204.9s - 2211.3s]: So a lot of CRISPR has actually been in the news lately. A lot of it's actually getting some bad press.\n\n[2212.0s - 2226.1s]: So it's the technology right now that we're using for gene editing. The reason I brought it up is actually so you mentioned that to your audience that I was teaching or co teaching right now, I'm a like it will laugh.\n\n[2226.8s - 2230.9s]: And so we used CRISPR technology in that molecular lab for gene editing.\n\n[2232.3s - 2246.8s]: So gene editing certain proteins into certain types of cells. So inserting a part of a genome or a part of a DNA sequence that encodes for a certain feature that was not previously in that cell.\n\n[2248.5s - 2265.7s]: And so CRISPR sometimes often called CRISPR Cas9 because Cas9 is the protein associated with it was actually first discovered in California, the University of California.\n\n[2265.7s - 2275.9s]: And it is a naturally occurring mechanism in bacteria that allows the bacteria to fight viruses. So it's like a snipping tool.\n\n[2276.4s - 2284.5s]: So it can cut out certain parts of the DNA so that the bacteria is no longer affected by a virus that viruses DNA.\n\n[2285.6s - 2296.2s]: And what researchers brilliantly figured out at the University of California is that these CRISPR systems, they're often called are highly conserved.\n\n[2296.5s - 2305.1s]: So they're in more than just bacteria and they can be inserted into other organisms and other types of cells.\n\n[2305.1s - 2317.5s]: And so that's where there's a lot of bioethics and a lot of bioethics committees. So I think the far reaching kind of fear is that film Gatica.\n\n[2318.2s - 2326.4s]: Right, if you've seen that where people are gene editing themselves and picking their children based on their eye color and all the science fiction.\n\n[2328.2s - 2335.4s]: Sometimes when you hear it in the news, it's always kind of worst case scenario too.\n\n[2335.8s - 2349.2s]: And I'm not saying we shouldn't think about worst case scenario because you can't, we were so in fixed even like in a science fiction culture to always have this worst case scenario of science that it's almost impossible.\n\n[2349.2s - 2355.5s]: I think to have that separate from real science as opposed to science fiction.\n\n[2356.2s - 2362.2s]: But the reason I kind of brought that up is that it's actually something that's going on in molecular lab.\n\n[2362.4s - 2374.4s]: This isn't specialists, these aren't PhDs and postdocs and doctors and these people that have crazy qualifications way, way above mine.\n\n[2376.9s - 2387.7s]: Alright, at these elite universities, this happening in molecular labs, it's something that's accessible, which I personally think is wonderful.\n\n[2388.8s - 2401.7s]: I think science as a community in itself has been becoming more accepting and trying to increase its diversity and still has a way to go.\n\n[2405.0s - 2411.3s]: But ultimately, when you can incorporate, in a sense, difficult concepts into teaching labs.\n\n[2411.6s - 2422.1s]: Again, you increase that accessibility to students and that really is also kind of that bridge where you were saying kind of that connection as well.\n\n[2422.8s - 2423.2s]: Absolutely.\n\n[2423.2s - 2427.0s]: Well, and it's so great, Maria, to have this opportunity to visit with you today.\n\n[2427.1s - 2441.7s]: And I think it's probably an opportunity for a lot of folks connected through the wider community to hear some more from a scientist about things that I imagine a lot of us don't have direct experience or knowledge of.\n\n[2442.3s - 2453.1s]: And it's been a real joy and I want to thank you for visiting with us and before we sign off for today, I'm wondering if there's anything else you'd like to share.\n\n[2453.2s - 2458.3s]: About the work you're doing and or to the liners community audience in general.\n\n[2458.8s - 2460.5s]: Yeah, so thanks for having me.\n\n[2461.0s - 2468.5s]: Really, I think my main message is that science is much more accessible than people like to think it is.\n\n[2468.8s - 2473.6s]: It's not white males and lab coats at Harvard.\n\n[2474.4s - 2481.2s]: It is a diverse community and it's actually one of the more accepting communities that I've luckily become a part of.\n\n[2481.8s - 2487.5s]: Going to conferences and I've met people from all around the world and that's just been amazing.\n\n[2488.7s - 2496.5s]: But that opportunity only started because I was you know, I was able to kind of show my curiosity in science.\n\n[2496.9s - 2504.5s]: So I think that's the main thing is that as soon as you show your curiosity, you know, you can reach out to scientists.\n\n[2504.5s - 2510.8s]: They're not like the scientist as an entity. They're not a big brother sitting in a corner, right?\n\n[2512.6s - 2521.6s]: Watching over your podcast. But they they're people and they have websites.\n\n[2521.9s - 2526.3s]: If you like certain type of research, so say you're really interested in what we've talked about today.\n\n[2526.7s - 2530.4s]: Go on a researcher's website. If you're really interested, I don't know.\n\n[2530.4s - 2538.2s]: In giraffe research. There's researchers that focus their entire careers on giraffes, which is I think fantastic.\n\n[2539.1s - 2546.4s]: But anything you're interested in, there's a researcher probably out there either doing it or looking for someone to help them do it.\n\n[2547.1s - 2554.7s]: And I think reaching out, showing your curiosity, science has become much more inclusive if I can say that.\n\n[2554.7s - 2565.1s]: And I usually scientists are curious people as far as the ones I've luckily encountered.\n\n[2566.8s - 2571.9s]: And sure, maybe you'll have one guy that's like, no, I don't want to do this.\n\n[2572.2s - 2575.9s]: This is my giraffe research. I don't want anyone involved in it.\n\n[2575.9s - 2578.5s]: Okay, you know what? There's someone else looking at this.\n\n[2579.1s - 2587.0s]: And so I think that accessibility, so that science is accessible to everyone, is kind of that message that I want to put out there.\n\n[2587.7s - 2594.8s]: That's really wonderful. And I'll mention to the audience in our show notes, we'll have links to a couple of the resources that you've shared.\n\n[2594.8s - 2600.0s]: One is the Miller Lab, where Maria does some of her work.\n\n[2600.1s - 2611.1s]: And if you go to microbial.systems, you can get to Miller Lab and the right and lab, which was also mentioned up at Colorado State University, is at right and lab.com.\n\n[2611.2s - 2617.7s]: And that's right in with a W. And of course in the show notes, we'll have the spelling for all of that and links for you.\n\n[2617.7s - 2631.4s]: And I hope we can also share an example of the visualization modeling that you do to give people a bit of a visual experience that they can check out.\n\n[2632.1s - 2636.1s]: And it's been such a joy talking with you, Maria.\n\n[2636.3s - 2645.1s]: And my mind's a little bog, with some of these concepts and some of the amazing diversity and the things that are being discovered right now and worked with.\n\n[2645.1s - 2650.3s]: And I really appreciate you taking the time to visit with us.\n\n[2650.5s - 2657.0s]: Yeah, well, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it. And I'll be back anytime you want.\n\n[2657.4s - 2659.0s]: That sounds great.
