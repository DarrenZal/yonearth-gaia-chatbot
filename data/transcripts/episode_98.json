  "full_transcript": "[10.0s - 21.6s]: Welcome to the Y on Earth community podcast. I'm your host, Aaron William Perry. And today we're visiting with Lin Boutsa from the Gretionum in Switzerland, Highland.\n\n[22.3s - 23.2s]: Hi everybody.\n\n[23.2s - 27.9s]: It's great to be with you today. Thanks for having me.\n\n[28.8s - 38.1s]: Absolutely. So Lin is scientific collaborator and project management at the section for agriculture at the Gretionum.\n\n[38.8s - 44.2s]: And the Gretionum is the global center for Rudolph Steiner's work and for the biodynamic movement.\n\n[44.2s - 56.6s]: She has extensive experience in research and science related to organic agriculture and climate stabilization strategies.\n\n[57.2s - 64.0s]: She did her bachelor of science at Brandon Bergshire Technischer University to co-edbus in Germany.\n\n[64.0s - 71.0s]: And also did her masters in science at the Ebersvalda University for sustainable development.\n\n[71.5s - 90.3s]: She has published numerous articles and research papers on these topics, including one called organic farming, climate change mitigation and beyond, reducing the environmental impacts of the European Union agriculture.\n\n[91.2s - 102.4s]: And so a particular import and interest is that the Gretionum is hosting its annual biodynamic conference in just a few weeks time.\n\n[102.6s - 110.6s]: And we're going to share some really exciting ways that people from all over can engage and get involved with this wonderful event.\n\n[110.6s - 123.4s]: And I want to mention to that Lin before working at the Gretionum was doing work at the research institute of organic agriculture as scientific coordinator for Solmack.\n\n[123.5s - 137.6s]: And that's the strategies for organic and low input farming to mitigate and adapt to climate change where she was doing research particularly focused on agricultural projects in Germany, Italy and Sweden.\n\n[138.2s - 157.2s]: So Lin, it's absolutely wonderful to have this opportunity to visit with you. And I'm so excited to have you share with us the work you all are doing at the Gretionum and that you're helping lead in the global biodynamic movement. So welcome.\n\n[158.0s - 161.2s]: Thank you very much. I'm happy to share.\n\n[162.0s - 176.0s]: Excellent. I'd like to I'd like to kick it right off by asking you to tell us what is the upcoming, you know, conference all about and why is it a particular importance right now in these times.\n\n[176.8s - 176.9s]: Yeah.\n\n[176.9s - 185.1s]: So the upcoming conference will be a climate conference and the topic will be briefing in the climate crisis.\n\n[186.2s - 193.3s]: And we're doing this in collaboration with the youth section at the Gretionum. So we really want to involve the youth in it.\n\n[193.3s - 206.0s]: And the idea is to really show that climate change and finding solutions for climate change is not a one dimensional problem, but that we have to tackle it from various dimension.\n\n[206.9s - 220.4s]: And in biodynamics, this is really a core issue because you look at agriculture in a way where you include the social and the environment perspective and the economic perspective.\n\n[220.4s - 227.8s]: But you broaden this perspective also by the spiritual dimension and to really include the spirituality as well.\n\n[228.3s - 244.3s]: And that's why we will look at these different core themes and show the how they are interconnected and yeah, by this we would like to provide holistic solutions for this problem we are facing.\n\n[244.3s - 260.3s]: And actually the theme was initiated before Corona, but I think briefing in the climate crisis becomes quite a double sided dimension at the moment as we are in this pandemic.\n\n[261.3s - 282.0s]: And yeah, the idea is to be able to breathe again and to really come out of the conference and have solutions for farmers, but also for us as youth young people so that we know how we can live in this world and continue to live in this world.\n\n[284.0s - 296.4s]: It's so wonderful. I am so excited and I'm really looking forward to participating and I think the why on earth community is going to help host one of the regional events.\n\n[296.4s - 303.1s]: It will be pretty small because of COVID obviously, but there are so many different ways people can engage.\n\n[303.1s - 308.5s]: Of course, a lot of this will be done online and through video and so on.\n\n[309.5s - 325.5s]: So I just I want to be really emphatic in inviting any of our audience who would like to dive deeper and learn more and also build more community with folks like you, Lin and your colleagues who are really helping to provide these holistic solutions.\n\n[325.5s - 337.7s]: And I think that's such an important key in all of this. And to me, it's encouraging. We're seeing more and more integration between economics and environmental and social and even the spiritual dimensions.\n\n[338.7s - 349.2s]: And it's interesting because in a lot of the scientific work and realm over the last several decades, it's there's been a lot of exclusion of the spiritual.\n\n[350.2s - 364.4s]: I'm curious for you as a scientist in Europe, how does that work when you're interacting with different colleagues working on policy and obviously not everyone's going to share the same spiritual beliefs?\n\n[365.4s - 379.8s]: Yeah, I mean, I think not everybody is sharing the same beliefs, but one thing that that is good is that many scientists work at the same time at this topic as well.\n\n[379.8s - 396.7s]: And by this scientific proof is given. And I mean, recently just one of the studies came out that, for example, organic and bio dynamic farming is producing much more carbon in the soil because of the root grows of the plants.\n\n[396.7s - 404.7s]: And these numbers help us on the one hand to to argue in this way of farming and say, okay, it's not just spirituality.\n\n[405.6s - 416.5s]: And even if you don't believe in the spiritual way for yourself, the numbers are scientifically proven to help tackle an important issue that we face globally.\n\n[417.5s - 425.2s]: And I think then everybody can decide if he or she wants to join the spirit of the dimension or not.\n\n[425.5s - 429.8s]: And I think that's a freedom of choice, but yeah.\n\n[430.5s - 445.4s]: Absolutely. And it's been my experience helping to host and offer bio dynamic stir ceremonies with soil activating preparations for communities all around the country.\n\n[445.4s - 467.1s]: That bio dynamics provides a really unique and potent venue and context for people with a variety of spiritual and religious backgrounds to come together in the very grounded connected practices working with the water and the preparations and the soil and the plants and the animals.\n\n[467.1s - 478.3s]: And so it seems to me to provide a unique nexus and I haven't found anything else that can do that in quite such a powerful way.\n\n[479.4s - 490.3s]: Yeah. And I mean, you can really feel it as well. If you visit the bio dynamic farm, it's it's a different atmosphere and it's you don't need to be a very spiritual person to experience, but.\n\n[490.3s - 501.0s]: But when you come at the farm, you feel maybe at home or if you eat the food of a bio dynamic farm, it has a different taste and it warms you in a different way.\n\n[501.3s - 517.2s]: So everybody can experience this experience in a personal way and that's the beauty about bio dynamic farming that gives an entry point for each person where they're standing in life.\n\n[518.5s - 546.2s]: Yeah, it's so beautiful. I have friends farming at sustainable settings in carbon deal Colorado up in the mountains, which is near Aspen, which of course has some very high end fine dining and some of the most celebrated chefs in the world really and they prefer sourcing produce and other food products from the bio dynamic farm because of the taste profile.\n\n[546.2s - 551.2s]: It's very interesting that you know they're noticing a real difference.\n\n[551.6s - 564.1s]: Yeah, and sometimes you even see it in the vegetables, for example, you can also see it by by just looking at the vegetables, how the structures are different in in bio dynamics, who bio dynamic produced food.\n\n[565.4s - 579.2s]: And yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, one of the other things that is really nice and bio dynamic farming is that it really gives the opportunity for people to to meet and often bio dynamic farms are very social places.\n\n[580.2s - 599.8s]: And I mean, at the moment, of course, this is also a little bit restricted in comparison to before Corona, but still it's often places where people come together and exchange and to get to know one another and to get to know farming as well.\n\n[600.0s - 607.5s]: So often it's also educational centers and for other farmers to learn new techniques, for example.\n\n[608.5s - 623.9s]: Yeah, absolutely beautiful. Well, I also I'm really excited to talk a bit about the living farms work that you guys are doing and I had the opportunity to view one of your videos recently to prepare for our discussion today.\n\n[623.9s - 639.0s]: And it seems that you guys are really taking advantage of the video and global communication technology to help invite people into experience something that you otherwise would only experience by visiting in person.\n\n[639.8s - 644.3s]: And I was hoping you could tell us a bit more about what's happening with the living farms project.\n\n[644.3s - 657.6s]: Yeah, so you got the idea of pretty right from the living farms project of the ideas to really show what bio dynamic places offer in this global challenges that we face.\n\n[657.9s - 671.7s]: And of course, this global challenges does not just include climate change, but also biodiversity loss and reduced soil fertility, nutrient run of water beautification.\n\n[671.7s - 680.8s]: So all of this problems that say with the convention agriculture system evolves and spread even further.\n\n[682.2s - 696.2s]: And yeah, we realized that biodynamic farming office a lot of possibilities to reduce these challenges and to really overcome these challenges.\n\n[696.2s - 710.5s]: And when I worked for the research Institute of Organic Agriculture in Switzerland as well, one of the main questions I asked myself and the research was we know so much at the moment.\n\n[710.5s - 725.9s]: And we know basically which farming techniques are sustainable and we know how good food system would look like, but what is really lacking is this adaptation of the farmers.\n\n[725.9s - 739.2s]: So what are the struggles that farmers face to take over these measurements and to say I would like to change to a sustainable agriculture system.\n\n[740.1s - 753.5s]: And I don't know how this in the US actually, but for Europe, it's at least that it's not a financial reason because often the farmers that farm organic or biodynamic are actually better off financially.\n\n[753.5s - 762.4s]: It can't be an environment reason because because the environment is better off with these farming systems.\n\n[763.2s - 765.2s]: So there must be a social reason for this.\n\n[765.6s - 778.1s]: And I found that one of the main licking links is that many research projects or even educational projects don't show farmers.\n\n[778.1s - 798.6s]: So you have this the scape that farmers don't, farmers are not shown in explaining their their thoughts and explaining how they implemented certain practices and why what their strategies are to overcome challenges or how they test different things.\n\n[798.6s - 810.8s]: And that's quite interesting, I think that we developed into a system that where the voices of farmers are sometimes not very heard enough.\n\n[812.6s - 828.3s]: And with the living farms project, we wanted to change that in a way, we wanted to show their solutions and we wanted to let farmers really speak and let them show us how they are, how they change the system and what their steps are.\n\n[828.6s - 842.8s]: And yeah, that's basically the idea to motivate other farmers to join the movement or to improve their own systems in a way by just looking at farmers and their farms.\n\n[843.7s - 849.5s]: And to see what great work they are doing on the farms.\n\n[849.5s - 877.3s]: Yeah, it's so wonderful. And yeah, the social aspect of this deep question of change and how to best realize substantial rapid change at scale around the world is so interesting and is, I think, a significant part of the theory of change, if you will, that we work with at the WON-Earth community.\n\n[877.3s - 890.2s]: And I was really impressed by the recent film, Kiss the Ground, in their feature, an expo, say, of farmers who are thinking about the potential for that change.\n\n[890.9s - 895.8s]: And these are farmers at scale and Brad Basket regions like the Midwest of the United States.\n\n[895.8s - 901.9s]: And we had Finne and Makepiece on the podcast, who was one of the producers of that film.\n\n[902.6s - 909.5s]: And it was really, really well done. And I'm just, I'm so excited that with your work, you've got a global scope.\n\n[909.9s - 924.9s]: And I'm curious with the Living Farms project, can you give us an idea of where some of these participating farms are located, how many so far, you know, are in this network and are featured in these videos that are being created.\n\n[926.3s - 939.6s]: So we started with a pilot in Switzerland at the Gutianno, actually, at the Garden of the Gutianno, because at the Gutianno, we also, there's also gardening.\n\n[941.4s - 945.0s]: What do you say that's a gardener, like, vertical.\n\n[947.7s - 951.9s]: And so we started on the ground, basically.\n\n[952.9s - 968.3s]: And then we portrayed one community farm in Germany, which is based off six families that farm together in a very interesting way.\n\n[969.6s - 976.1s]: Then we have portrayed two farms in Kenya.\n\n[978.0s - 989.3s]: So one farm, which is a school, actually, where they have a school garden, and they really educate the biodynamic farmers also in Kenya.\n\n[989.3s - 1006.5s]: And one farm where they have five thousand smallholder farmers to produce together, Macedonia, and so they have like, each of the farmers has about one hectare of land, and they produce this under one label.\n\n[1007.3s - 1011.9s]: And then we visited this year, but the movies are not out yet.\n\n[1013.2s - 1017.6s]: So they will be released on the conference.\n\n[1018.3s - 1021.7s]: So one more reason to be part of the conference, maybe.\n\n[1022.5s - 1028.2s]: So we have visited one farm in Lithuania, which was very interesting.\n\n[1028.4s - 1034.9s]: So it's a grain farmer, basically, but he's also having highland cattle.\n\n[1035.9s - 1040.4s]: And one farm for wine production.\n\n[1041.0s - 1044.5s]: So there was an Italy.\n\n[1046.2s - 1053.3s]: And one farm in Finland, where they are doing a CSA, so community supported agriculture.\n\n[1054.8s - 1055.6s]: Yeah.\n\n[1056.7s - 1058.2s]: It's so far.\n\n[1058.8s - 1066.1s]: And if the traveling was at the moment in Europe, the traveling restrictions are quite heavy.\n\n[1066.4s - 1070.3s]: So I couldn't visit all the farms that I wanted to visit.\n\n[1070.9s - 1078.1s]: But as soon as the regulations were softened a bit, we will produce further movies.\n\n[1079.0s - 1079.6s]: Beautiful.\n\n[1081.1s - 1091.9s]: I'm excited because I'm thinking of a few farms here in Colorado and elsewhere in the United States that might be excited to share a video this way as well.\n\n[1092.2s - 1096.1s]: So I'm happy to help make some connections if that's helpful.\n\n[1096.6s - 1097.5s]: Yeah, it's nice.\n\n[1098.9s - 1106.6s]: The the macadamia farm is that so are all those different?\n\n[1106.9s - 1110.2s]: You got 5,000 smallholders? Are they all practicing biodynamics?\n\n[1111.8s - 1113.3s]: Not all of them.\n\n[1113.5s - 1117.2s]: So they started from the beginning with organic farming.\n\n[1118.5s - 1121.6s]: And now they're shifting towards biodynamics.\n\n[1122.6s - 1128.8s]: So in January, it was about 100 farmers that practice now ready biodynamics.\n\n[1129.5s - 1133.2s]: And they are also getting a demeter certification.\n\n[1133.6s - 1135.8s]: I think last year.\n\n[1136.6s - 1138.2s]: So we are in January.\n\n[1138.6s - 1139.2s]: So last year.\n\n[1141.2s - 1147.5s]: And yeah, the idea would be to motivate most of the farmers for biodynamics.\n\n[1147.5s - 1151.2s]: But they're really doing this in a very participatory way.\n\n[1151.4s - 1161.9s]: So they just provide the education and the farmers then can decide individually if they would like to shift towards biodynamics or if they would like to stay with organic.\n\n[1162.7s - 1162.8s]: Yeah.\n\n[1163.0s - 1170.6s]: And that was quite interesting because most of the farmers I talked with, they really shifted to biodynamics out of a very,\n\n[1170.6s - 1174.4s]: very, very, very huge curiosity.\n\n[1174.8s - 1186.7s]: It was very interesting to see because they really wanted to like with the preparation they found it so interesting to start this this way of farming and they said, oh, I want to try if it really works.\n\n[1187.2s - 1195.4s]: And then they were so convinced that they told the other farmer neighbors that it really works for the macadamian ads.\n\n[1195.4s - 1213.0s]: And so in this way, it's a very interesting aspect that they entered the biodynamics out of curiosity and just like to get to know something new, which I think was a great way of testing something.\n\n[1214.0s - 1221.0s]: You know, it makes me smile. I've heard several stories of even conventional farmers,\n\n[1222.0s - 1245.1s]: creating the results of biodynamics and often, you know, it involves tears of joy and just the, the impact of observing that there can be such dramatic changes and effects in the vitality and the biodiversity and the quality of a given farm or even ecosystem.\n\n[1246.1s - 1252.1s]: And it's a beautiful thing to know that this can spread all around the world really.\n\n[1253.9s - 1270.7s]: And it can be applied everywhere. That's also, it's also nice thing that they really try to adapt it also to the region and really to find for the preparations the materials that they can use locally as well.\n\n[1270.7s - 1283.3s]: And I think that's a huge, yeah, empowerment in a way for the people to get to know a concept which can be applied everywhere according to your local conditions.\n\n[1284.0s - 1289.9s]: And you can really adapt it to your own system that you have on your farm.\n\n[1290.8s - 1308.8s]: This is, this is so interesting. So with the case of the macadamia farmers in Kenya, are they making the preparations with their own cattle and herbs or are they bringing preparations and like, how does that kind of work in terms of the nuts and bolts, if you will.\n\n[1309.6s - 1319.6s]: Yeah, so, so the two farm like the two places we visited to do it in different ways. The one is like really doing it.\n\n[1320.7s - 1337.6s]: According to the, let's say, original instructions of, of wood of Steiner, so he's like doing it very precise and he has like little, for example, for the, the oak bark preparations, he cultivated like the little oak bars.\n\n[1338.8s - 1340.7s]: The oaks in his farm.\n\n[1342.4s - 1353.0s]: But then there's also the other way of the people that they try to find, let's say, a tree that is similar in the characteristics of a oak.\n\n[1353.5s - 1363.8s]: And that they try to get the spirit of the oak and realize which tree would be, would be similar in their region.\n\n[1363.8s - 1367.1s]: And then they adapt the preparations accordingly.\n\n[1368.1s - 1368.2s]: Yeah.\n\n[1368.6s - 1374.4s]: So I think you can go both ways. That's also a question of the own personality and character as well.\n\n[1375.0s - 1384.4s]: Yeah. It's so beautiful and it's interesting to me and it sort of indicates some of the complexity that emerges when we're dealing with living systems.\n\n[1384.4s - 1393.9s]: And I'm curious about the, the Demeter certification, right? And as we're seeing more and more biodynamic products coming into the market, it's great, right?\n\n[1394.0s - 1401.0s]: Because that's one of the ways we as consumers can support the movement by buying those food and beverage products and clothing products.\n\n[1401.4s - 1411.4s]: So how is that being handled in terms of, you know, Demeter, you know, verifying and ensuring certain practices are happening.\n\n[1411.4s - 1416.9s]: But also allowing for those local adaptations and variations.\n\n[1418.2s - 1439.8s]: I have to admit, I'm not such an expert in the certification process, but as far as I know, with those international certifications, there's a little bit of the possibility to vary in the regulations according to local conditions.\n\n[1442.5s - 1452.7s]: But still the basic standards should be, should be achieved, like, should be according to law, of course.\n\n[1453.0s - 1461.5s]: But I'm not sure with the preparations, actually, if like how, how much adaptation is possible. And of course, it's also question of like,\n\n[1461.5s - 1474.5s]: a lot of, or some of the biodynamics, or some of the farmers that practice biodynamics, they're not Demeter certified, but they practice the biodynamics without having the certification.\n\n[1475.1s - 1480.2s]: So it's also question of if you have the certification or not.\n\n[1480.7s - 1488.9s]: And what kind of certificate, certifying person you have to take at your farm.\n\n[1488.9s - 1499.9s]: Yeah, yeah, cool. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Now, okay, I know a lot of our audience is familiar with biodynamics, but some of our audience isn't.\n\n[1500.6s - 1511.4s]: And so I would ask you, if somebody were asking for the first time, you know, what is biodynamics? How is it different from, you know, other organic practices or what have you?\n\n[1513.9s - 1526.7s]: What, you know, what is your response and how do you convey somewhat succinctly all of these really interesting detailed elements that go into the biodynamic practice and experience?\n\n[1527.7s - 1530.5s]: Hmm, not an easy question.\n\n[1531.7s - 1544.5s]: Because the biodynamics is quite complex in a way. And I think it also depends who you ask what biodynamics is.\n\n[1545.5s - 1564.0s]: For me personally, I think what resonates most is the idea of Udosh Dynath to farm in a way of a farm organism and that you have an individuality at the farm and that you create a system where\n\n[1564.0s - 1580.5s]: where the different elements of a farm so that can be cow's plants, soil, the atmosphere, the social sphere, that they come together in a way that they are really one.\n\n[1581.7s - 1594.6s]: Now I'm lacking the English word like one one part in a way so that they are not separate, but they really intervene with one another and that they form this farm organism.\n\n[1594.6s - 1624.6s]: And then you have this idea of the farm individuality that if you have a farm organism and the human comes into the system and create a cultivates landscape and the farm that one individuality evolves out of it and that can something which can be experienced as I said at the beginning in the atmosphere, but also the taste of the product and in the smell of a product.\n\n[1625.9s - 1647.8s]: Or the soils and of course then so that's personally for me the main difference and this individualities show in different characteristics and from my research, I could say some of the characteristics are quite common in biodynamic farmers.\n\n[1647.8s - 1672.7s]: So when I just mentioned with the curiosity, but also with the social aspect that often biodynamic farms are places where people come together, then you have like often a very deep love to to the soil and to the animal and that you really and plants as well.\n\n[1672.7s - 1680.9s]: And also this interconnection that you really want to see the spirit of a plant and the spirit of a soil and the spirit of each animal.\n\n[1682.4s - 1688.5s]: And then of course we have these other tools which which are the preparations, which is mentioned.\n\n[1689.5s - 1713.9s]: So that's something which is used in biodynamics and not in organic farming and and then it can also be farmed for example to the Maria tune calendar, which is the moon calendar, which is also included in the biodynamics and other natural rhythms.\n\n[1713.9s - 1730.0s]: So basically I would say by an economics is the is a way to farm where you try to integrate the different parts of a farm into the natural rhythms and needs in a way.\n\n[1731.0s - 1743.3s]: Yeah beautifully put and I actually love how you're able to bring together all of these different elements and dimensions in a relatively short description.\n\n[1743.3s - 1773.1s]: And I wanted to you know, no pun intended dig a little deeper on the the preparations themselves right because in my experiences a very unique aspect of biodynamic farming where essentially we're creating herbal medicines if you will and almost like homeopathic soil based out chemical medicines for the for the land and the soil and the water and the plants and animals.\n\n[1773.3s - 1779.5s]: Can you describe for us a little bit you know what the preparations are and what that's all about.\n\n[1781.9s - 1800.1s]: Yeah so basically the idea of the preparations is that you have specific plants or materials that you use and sometimes they're so so for example, not so good in the English words.\n\n[1801.1s - 1827.0s]: The nettle for example, the nettles a very special plant in a way and it grows in on special places and if you use that as a preparation for the for the compost idea is that this quality of the plant is then included into the compost and that is the overall compost qualities enhanced for the whole farm.\n\n[1828.5s - 1850.0s]: And yeah, that we have the different preparations and their their mate and made a different timings so that depends if you're in the winter time or in the summertime and of course in the tropics there's always this challenge that you need to adapt the timing as well.\n\n[1851.2s - 1871.8s]: And yeah, as he said it's it's a way of a little bit like homeopathy and and to use it all over the farm and it's also again a very social aspect as well so the people come together and they stir the preparations and then they then they sprayed on the fields.\n\n[1872.5s - 1894.1s]: So that's that's quite a often quite a very social aspect that comes there and but then there are also biodynamic farms that are not so eager in the preparations, but they are very focused on other biodynamic practices so that's that difference and that depends on the individualities that come together.\n\n[1895.6s - 1923.1s]: Wonderful. Yeah, thank you so much. I want to remind our audience that this is the Why on Earth Community podcast and I'm your host Aaron William Perry today we're visiting with Lynn Boutsa from the Guertianum in Switzerland and they linen her colleagues are hosting in just a few weeks a very special annual agricultural conference for biodynamics this year with a focus on climate solutions.\n\n[1931.1s - 1939.8s]: And you can find out more about the conference by going to agriculture dash conference dot org slash 2021.\n\n[1940.5s - 1961.0s]: You can go to learn more about the Guertianum, which is the headquarters for Rudolph Steiner's work at Guertianum.org and of course we'll have all this in the show notes for you and check out living farms dot net to experience these wonderful videos being created by biodynamic farms all around the world.\n\n[1961.6s - 1973.2s]: And I want to give a thanks and shout out to our sponsors making our podcast series possible and the community mobilization and climate action work of the Why on Earth Community possible.\n\n[1973.2s - 1996.6s]: And this includes Earth Coast productions, the Lidge family foundation Alpine Botanicals, Purium, Earth Hero, liquid trainer, Vera, Irbals, growing spaces, soil works, earth water press, 1% for the planet, Dr. Bronners and Wele Waters.\n\n[1997.4s - 2012.6s]: Now on the why on earth dot org website you can go to the partners and supporters page that's why on earth dot org slash partners dash supporters to get discounts from most of these companies on their products and services.\n\n[2012.6s - 2034.2s]: A special thanks to Wele Waters, one of our social enterprises who provide biodynamic hemp infused aroma therapy soaking salts massage oils and saves and they are offering special monthly gifts for folks who joined our monthly contributor program.\n\n[2034.9s - 2052.4s]: If you join at the $33 level or greater you'll get monthly shipments of the Wele Waters soaking salts, you can join at any level and if you haven't joined yet and you'd like to you can go to why on earth dot org slash support to join our monthly contributor circle.\n\n[2052.4s - 2065.3s]: So a thanks to all of our supporters and a special thanks Lynn to you and your colleagues for all the work you're doing in the biodynamic movement and helping to spread this even further now.\n\n[2065.3s - 2070.1s]: And of course one of my very favorite quotes from Rudolph Steiner i don't have it right with me.\n\n[2071.3s - 2094.5s]: I may have included the show notes is about how it's so important for us to spread the biodynamic practices as far and wide as we can around the world to help deal with these nutrition problems that we're facing and of course it's as if he was anticipating many of these other interconnected challenges like climate and the toxicification of our soil and water and environments through.\n\n[2097.0s - 2110.9s]: And so it's just wonderful that you guys are leading the charge as it were with all of this and I guess Lynn I want to ask you what about the upcoming conference are you most excited about.\n\n[2111.9s - 2112.1s]: hmm.\n\n[2113.1s - 2125.9s]: Um, tough question because there are so many so many interesting things so of course there will be a very great presentations from different people that that i'm excited to hear.\n\n[2127.0s - 2131.4s]: But personally I think I'm most excited for the future labs part.\n\n[2133.5s - 2149.5s]: Because in the future labs the idea is that that people will really work on 20 different topics that are related to climate change and in each of the future labs and expert will be will be present and.\n\n[2149.5s - 2160.5s]: And so the participants will develop their own questions for their farms or for their personal life and really go into the solution finding.\n\n[2161.7s - 2171.8s]: And so at the end of the conference hopefully all of the participants from the future labs will go out and say okay I know exactly where my vision is and what I want to achieve and.\n\n[2171.8s - 2181.5s]: And how I can reduce my footprint I have on earth and on the with this concrete next steps and I think that's.\n\n[2182.3s - 2186.6s]: That's something where I feel very excited about because.\n\n[2186.6s - 2205.2s]: I don't know how you feel but for me often in this world we face so many challenges but we don't have a clear vision how our society should look like and how a positive society should look like and.\n\n[2205.2s - 2216.5s]: And I think if you formulate for yourself how a good future and a good vision for you as a person but also for society can can be.\n\n[2217.3s - 2231.5s]: Then we really have the potential to go into this direction and focus on these steps and say okay i'm taking part in this and that's that's for me quite exciting to start that experiment.\n\n[2232.3s - 2237.7s]: That's a beautiful I am smiling over here with.\n\n[2239.0s - 2257.2s]: Agreement and resonance it's so important to have clear vision and I'm actually late in the process of finishing a novel an epic novel that presents this kind of vision in the story is a deep exploration of biodynamics.\n\n[2257.2s - 2279.7s]: So yeah it's it's one of we we can do so much in terms of healing our planet and our our social and economic challenges and dysfunctions really and I believe in my heart that biodynamics offers something very special at the core of what's possible for us to.\n\n[2279.7s - 2291.7s]: To create an amplify together as a as a global community of humans and so it's just wonderful and I'm really i'm really looking forward to the conference.\n\n[2293.3s - 2309.6s]: And I know why on earth is going to help participate and invite some others in our network to to be involved and and it's great knowing you know you're doing all all the work you're doing as a scientist and as a biodynamic practitioner.\n\n[2309.6s - 2329.6s]: And also you have been part of the negotiations related to the global communities work on climate change and you recently were involved in negotiations and bond for the UNF CCC and I was curious if you might tell us a bit about that aspect of the work that you're doing.\n\n[2331.6s - 2348.7s]: Yeah I think that that came with my was my study course so like I studied global change management where we really try to analyze global systems and to really look at things in a systemic way.\n\n[2351.1s - 2378.0s]: And for me policy belongs with it I mean I believe in grassroots movements and I believe also in local acting and at the at the same time I still believe that we need for some of the issues also global policy and whether you an after will see I find it quite interesting that that you have this policy development way really.\n\n[2378.0s - 2404.4s]: The different states come together and try to negotiate a consensus and try to find a solution for for all the countries and of course it's you can't see it without critics I mean this always also bad sides about policy political developments and and I don't want to go into this one steeper but but for me it was very.\n\n[2406.5s - 2431.7s]: Very promising to see that people can come together and and discuss things and partly find solutions for things for challenges and and I mean it's also something which touches me a little bit now with the corona situation because because I think it's the first time that we as a global society reacted in a very fast and.\n\n[2437.7s - 2461.6s]: And I think that we are not able anymore to do this so there will be no excuse to not go into the climate change solution finding and it's clear that we are capable of humans to do this and we have to do this.\n\n[2461.7s - 2474.4s]: We have to find a resources if we needed and and that's yeah that that there needs to be step steps that need to be done in the future.\n\n[2474.4s - 2504.2s]: Yeah yeah beautiful yeah so I know that you're living in a in a small village community rural community in Switzerland but you grew up in Berlin and you know had a very sort of urban lifestyle in your youth and I'm curious you know how is it different for you going from a big city like Berlin to a.\n\n[2504.2s - 2514.3s]: Small village and you know what tell us you know what what what you like about it and maybe also what's sometimes challenging about it.\n\n[2516.6s - 2542.0s]: So for the for the challenges I have to admit that I sometimes miss the food of Berlin because because I grew up in a very multi-cultural district and and we had yeah we had food from from all of the different cultures that come together in Berlin which I sometimes really miss.\n\n[2543.6s - 2569.1s]: But for the for the opportunities of living in the in the rural areas I mean for me I I think I never felt so home in a way because I I can connect with the nature more deeply and and I can go two minutes and I'm in the forest like can walk for hours in the forest which is for me personally really great.\n\n[2569.1s - 2598.5s]: So whenever I feel a little bit I can I can go outside and I I also think that it's quite healthy in a way because the number of people is also restricted and as I said we're living in a very small village so it's 100 people and also the philosopher who so said for example that you can that 100 people is the limit that you can.\n\n[2599.1s - 2627.8s]: Grasp as a person and way you can empathically think of the others and that you're capable of having them on your on your mind and that's something that I that I feel because in the cities sometimes it's very numerous and you're a little bit lost in a way but here you're much more connected and I think that's the same when you're.\n\n[2629.1s - 2640.2s]: And on a farm and working with the people on the farm that's that you're more socially grounded and grounded with the for the nature as well.\n\n[2641.1s - 2649.3s]: Yeah yeah it was a good change to move from Berlin to the area with the land here.\n\n[2650.3s - 2657.5s]: In addition to all the work you're doing with climate and soil and agriculture and biodynamics and work out the good to you on them.\n\n[2658.5s - 2666.7s]: You're also working as a yoga teacher and working on a music therapy education program is that right.\n\n[2667.8s - 2667.8s]: \n\n[2669.2s - 2672.4s]: Tell us about that what what what's going on with those.\n\n[2673.5s - 2693.4s]: Yeah I mean yoga is for me a good good way to release tension in the body so it's like on the one hand a good sport but it has also quite some similarities to the biodynamics philosophy and anthroposophical philosophy.\n\n[2693.4s - 2703.5s]: So good of China I don't know he was never in India but he seemed to be quite connected to the to the Vedic philosophies.\n\n[2703.8s - 2718.8s]: Yeah and yeah it helps you to to school your perception in a way and to to school yourself for for acknowledging nature as well.\n\n[2719.7s - 2732.6s]: And with a music I mean everybody that has worked on a farm knows how much a farm can make different sounds and how much sounds developed from nature so.\n\n[2733.4s - 2747.9s]: And I think that's a beautiful thing if you're connected with the nature you heal all here all of this different sounds and so music therapy is quite a quite a good way and I want you to start that so it's just starting this year.\n\n[2748.8s - 2750.8s]: Oh that's beautiful absolutely beautiful.\n\n[2751.6s - 2761.4s]: You know I'm struck sort of wrapping this back up and coming back around to the upcoming conference and the biodynamics work.\n\n[2762.2s - 2778.8s]: I'm struck that in the in the soil stewardship handbook that we published a couple of years ago we share a statistic a fact that says a 10% increase in soil carbon worldwide is equivalent to sequester.\n\n[2778.8s - 2808.8s]: And I'm not just mastering all of the fossil carbon that we've released since the beginning of the industrial revolution and I'm not necessarily putting you on the spot to say whether or not that's true we can follow up later on the numbers but you know it strikes me that our work with the soil in communities around the planet in particular with the biodynamic tools and techniques really might just get us to the kind of future and color.\n\n[2808.8s - 2832.8s]: And I think that's a culture that we long for and that we might imagine an envision together and so it gives me huge hope and I'm wondering what how it feels for you and in your heart what is your experience knowing the potential and also knowing the scope of the challenges as a scientist.\n\n[2834.4s - 2839.3s]: What is your what is your heart telling you about what biodynamics might be able to help us do.\n\n[2841.6s - 2852.6s]: I think I have to be I have to give my recentific answer I'm hope that's that's okay and I will try to explain it in a way that's not too scientific.\n\n[2855.0s - 2866.2s]: So like having the idea to solve all of the climate problems so should solely on on with the soil.\n\n[2867.1s - 2873.1s]: So what I would personally be a little bit of dangerous vision.\n\n[2875.2s - 2896.1s]: Because when you look at the soils and see how they work you come up at a certain time at a maximum of carbon that can be stored in the soil and after this time the carbon is recycled again and again and released to the atmosphere again and then going back.\n\n[2896.1s - 2900.3s]: So you at one point you have a saturation point of the soil.\n\n[2902.5s - 2929.3s]: However, if you manage your soil in a sustainable way increasing the carbon that often comes along with for example less machinery use which has climate change benefits or you have a good crop rotation which also comes along with mitigation potential for climate change.\n\n[2929.3s - 2938.4s]: And at the same time an adaptation potential because when your soil is better you can I'm sure you know this as a farmer when when you have heavy rainfall.\n\n[2939.0s - 2949.5s]: Your soil and your soils in a good quality it will soak up the water or if you have a drought it will not dry this past as maybe the neighboring fields.\n\n[2950.5s - 2971.9s]: And so I think organic or in particular biodynamic practices come with practices that increase the soil quality and by this also the mitigation potential but they offer much more solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\n[2972.9s - 2997.2s]: And that's I think the beauty because you can't expect to have or it would be it would be said if we do the mistake again to just put one perspective on a farming system and we need to develop or for me personally biodynamics is a system where you tackle several things at the same time.\n\n[2998.2s - 3010.9s]: You reduce the pesticide herbicide use and synthetic fertilizers which come with a huge greenhouse gas potential and they need large quantities of energy to be produced.\n\n[3011.7s - 3021.6s]: At the same time you increase the soil carbon you have smaller animal hospriety which comes with less methane for example.\n\n[3022.6s - 3050.1s]: You have good crop rotations and results that grow better you have again the social system that you have more local farming system where the customers buy it at the farms or where smaller farm markets happen where the customers can buy local food which comes with reduced emissions of transportation freezing and storage and.\n\n[3050.1s - 3062.6s]: And all of this and I think that's a combination which is very fruitful and and that's the the power of biodynamics and organic farming in a way.\n\n[3063.6s - 3065.9s]: But I wouldn't put it on one.\n\n[3067.4s - 3068.9s]: But specifically.\n\n[3069.9s - 3085.7s]: Now with the 100% on that in fact we've got colleagues working in so many sectors energy transportation I mean across the board not even in agriculture and clearly all of these different pieces and solutions are critical.\n\n[3086.8s - 3106.2s]: I get excited thinking about the way in which biodynamics particularly offers so many such a big basket of solutions and many of which you mentioned and spoken about so it makes me excited that's that's not all I'll share all day long.\n\n[3106.7s - 3107.7s]: Me too.\n\n[3110.3s - 3126.3s]: So now you know we need to wrap up Lynn and I'm so happy we have this opportunity to speak with you and I have to take the advantage of telling a really really cheesy joke that I get to share when I encounter German speakers.\n\n[3126.3s - 3130.3s]: I was hot and then you a divorced hot.\n\n[3133.5s - 3142.3s]: Which which maybe you can translate for our audience but before we before we conclude for today Lynn.\n\n[3143.0s - 3152.5s]: I want to thank you for taking the time to visit with us and if there's anything else you'd like to say or share with our audience please the floor is yours.\n\n[3152.5s - 3176.7s]: Yes so I'm I'm also very grateful for the possibility to come here online and to meet you online and your audience as well and yeah I would just say the brave and curious and start to continue the great work you're doing on your farm and your audience as well.\n\n[3177.7s - 3188.1s]: And yeah you welcome to join Switzerland in the conference and maybe it's another time when traveling is possible again.\n\n[3189.2s - 3194.1s]: Yeah beautiful well thank you very much Lynn it's really appreciated.\n\n[3197.0s - 3212.0s]: Yeah and the saying was that everything has an end but only the sausage has two ends which speaks a lot about our culture that the sausages have such a big impact.\n\n[3212.0s - 3212.9s]: Yes.\n\n[3213.5s - 3217.6s]: It's not trolling the philosophical constructs as it would.\n\n[3219.5s - 3224.4s]: Thanks so much Lynn it's wonderful connecting with you and look forward to collaborating with you more.\n\n[3225.3s - 3228.9s]: Yes we are too.
