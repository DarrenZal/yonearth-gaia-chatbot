# Book Formatting Fix Report

## Issue Identified

The API responses for book entries were showing incorrectly formatted metadata:

**Before Fix:**
```json
{
  "title": "VIRIDITAS: THE GREAT HEALING - Chapter 486.0: | Aaron William Perry",
  "guest_name": "Author: Aaron William Perry"
}
```

**After Fix:**
```json
{
  "title": "Chapter 486", 
  "guest_name": "Aaron William Perry"
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Pinecone Vector Database**: Contained correct raw metadata with fields like:
   - `author`: "Aaron William Perry"
   - `book_title`: "VIRIDITAS: THE GREAT HEALING"
   - `chapter_number`: 486.0
   - `chapter_title`: "| Aaron William Perry" (problematic but not the root cause)

2. **BM25 Chain Formatting**: The formatting logic in `src/rag/bm25_chain.py` was CORRECT:
   ```python
   'title': f"Chapter {chapter_int}",
   'guest_name': author,
   ```

3. **Simple Server Override**: The issue was in `simple_server.py` lines 87-95, which was overriding the correct formatting:
   ```python
   # PROBLEMATIC CODE (now fixed)
   formatted_source.update({
       'guest_name': f"Author: {author}",
       'title': source.get('title', f"{book_title} - Chapter {chapter_num}")
   })
   ```

## Solution Applied

Updated `simple_server.py` to trust the correctly formatted values from `bm25_chain.py` instead of overriding them:

```python
# FIXED CODE
# For book content, the bm25_chain already provides correct formatting
# Just pass through the correctly formatted values
if source.get('content_type') == 'book':
    # bm25_chain.py already formats these correctly:
    # - title: f"Chapter {chapter_int}" 
    # - guest_name: author (without "Author:" prefix)
    # - episode_number: f"Book: {book_title}"
    # So we don't need to override them
    pass
```

## Verification

Tested with query "what is viriditas?" and confirmed:
- ✅ `title`: "Chapter 554", "Chapter 486"
- ✅ `guest_name`: "Aaron William Perry"
- ✅ `episode_number`: "Book: VIRIDITAS: THE GREAT HEALING"

## Remaining Issue (Not Critical)

The `chapter_title` field in Pinecone contains "| Aaron William Perry" instead of actual chapter names. This suggests the PDF chapter detection regex in `book_processor.py` is matching page headers rather than real chapter titles. However, this doesn't affect the API response since we use `f"Chapter {chapter_number}"` for the title.
