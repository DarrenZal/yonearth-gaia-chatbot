# Agent 4: Knowledge Graph Extraction - Episodes 0-43
## Final Summary Report

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Agent:** Agent 4
**Task:** Extract entities and relationships from episodes 0-43

---

## Executive Summary

Agent 4 successfully implemented a comprehensive knowledge graph extraction system for YonEarth podcast episodes 0-43. The system uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to extract entities, relationships, and metadata from podcast transcripts, processing them systematically through chunking and extraction pipelines.

### Key Achievements

✅ **Entity Extractor Created** - Robust extraction of 10 entity types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, CONCEPT, PRACTICE, PLACE, etc.)
✅ **Relationship Extractor Created** - Extraction of 18 relationship types with contextual descriptions
✅ **Episode Processing Pipeline** - Automated chunking and extraction with error handling and retry logic
✅ **Monitoring Tools** - Progress tracking and summary report generation scripts
✅ **Production Deployment** - Background processing system running continuously

## System Architecture

### 1. Entity Extractor (`src/knowledge_graph/extractors/entity_extractor.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Extracts 10 entity types: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, CONCEPT, PLACE, PRACTICE, PRODUCT, EVENT, TECHNOLOGY, ECOSYSTEM, SPECIES
- Handles entity deduplication and aggregation across chunks
- Tracks entity aliases and metadata
- Includes retry logic for API failures

**Technology:**
- Model: GPT-4o-mini (cost-efficient)
- Temperature: 0.1 (consistent extraction)
- Rate limiting: 1 second between calls

### 2. Relationship Extractor (`src/knowledge_graph/extractors/relationship_extractor.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Extracts 15+ relationship types (FOUNDED, WORKS_FOR, LOCATED_IN, PRACTICES, USES, etc.)
- Links entities with contextual descriptions
- Deduplicates relationship mentions across chunks

**Design:**
- Two-phase extraction: entities first, then relationships
- Validates relationships against extracted entities
- Maintains chunk-level provenance

### 3. Chunking Module (`src/knowledge_graph/extractors/chunking.py`)

**Features:**
- Token-based chunking using tiktoken
- Default: 500 tokens per chunk with 50-token overlap
- Preserves context across chunk boundaries
- Accurate token counting for GPT models

### 4. Processing Pipeline (`scripts/extract_knowledge_graph_episodes_0_43.py`)

**Workflow:**
1. Load episode transcript from JSON
2. Chunk transcript into 500-token segments
3. Extract entities from each chunk
4. Extract relationships based on entities
5. Aggregate and deduplicate results
6. Save to JSON file with metadata

**Features:**
- Graceful error handling
- Progress logging
- Skip already-processed episodes
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

3. **Monitor with:** `python3 scripts/check_kg_progress.py`
4. **Final report:** `python3 scripts/generate_kg_summary_report.py`

### Integration Points

- **Neo4j Import**: Extracted data is ready for graph database import
- **Visualization**: Data structure supports network visualization
- **Search**: Entities and relationships can be indexed for search
- **Analysis**: Statistics available for trend analysis

---

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: Settings Validation Error

**Problem:** Pydantic settings validation failed due to Neo4j environment variables
**Solution:** Modified script to load environment variables directly with `python-dotenv`

### Issue 2: Environment Variable Loading

**Problem:** OPENAI_API_KEY not available when running script
**Solution:** Added `load_dotenv()` to script initialization

### Issue 3: Duplicate Script Runs

**Problem:** Multiple Python processes running extraction
**Solution:** Extraction script checks for existing files and skips them
