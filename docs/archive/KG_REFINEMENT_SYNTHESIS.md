# Knowledge Graph Refinement System: Implementation Synthesis & Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This synthesis consolidates research from two comprehensive analyses into a practical implementation roadmap for fixing and preventing errors like "Boulder LOCATED_IN Lafayette" in the YonEarth knowledge graph. The system moves from 11,678 entities and 4,220 relationships with logical errors to a self-improving, production-grade graph through iterative multi-pass refinement.

**Key Achievement Targets:**
- 95% detection rate for logical errors
- 90% accuracy for entity resolution
- 30-50% improvement in downstream query accuracy
- Zero "Boulder LOCATED_IN Lafayette" type errors

## Part 1: Synthesized Research Findings & Actionable Steps

### 1.1 Core Architecture Insights

The research converges on a **6-pass iterative refinement pipeline** that treats the knowledge graph as a living, self-improving ecosystem rather than a static dataset. Both research documents emphasize:

1. **Modular Pass System**: Each refinement stage is encapsulated with consistent interfaces (validate, execute, rollback, metrics)
2. **Provenance-First Design**: Every change creates an immutable audit trail using PROV-O standards
3. **Ensemble Validation**: Multiple weak validators combine for robust error detection
4. **Self-Supervised Learning**: The graph learns from its own high-confidence patterns

**Actionable Implementation Steps:**
```python
# Base architecture (implement first)
class RefinementPass:
    """Universal interface for all passes"""
    def validate(self, graph): pass  # Pre-check
    def execute(self, graph): pass   # Core logic
    def rollback(self, graph): pass  # Undo capability
    def metrics(self, graph): pass   # Impact measurement

class Patch:
    """Immutable change record"""
    op: Literal["REVERSE_EDGE", "MERGE_ENTITY", "RETYPE_REL", "DELETE", "ADD", "REWEIGHT"]
    target: str  # Assertion ID
    evidence: List[Evidence]  # Why this change
    provenance: ProvRecord   # Who/when/how
```

### 1.2 Validation Strategy Synthesis

Both documents emphasize a **hybrid validation approach** combining deterministic and probabilistic methods:

**Deterministic Layer (SHACL/ShEx):**
- Antisymmetry constraints (located_in cannot be bidirectional)
- Acyclicity in hierarchies (no location loops)
- Domain/range type checking
- Cardinality constraints

**Probabilistic Ensemble:**
1. **LLM Common-Sense Judge** - GPT-4 evaluates plausibility
2. **Embedding Anomaly Detection** - TransE geometric consistency
3. **Learned Logical Rules** - PSL discovers patterns from data
4. **External Knowledge Cross-Check** - GeoNames/Wikidata validation

**Key Innovation:** The "**2+ validator agreement**" rule - only make changes when multiple independent validators concur, preventing overcorrection.

### 1.3 Entity Resolution Breakthrough

The research identifies a sophisticated **3-stage ER pipeline** that goes beyond simple string matching:

**Stage 1: Semantic Blocking**
- Use embedding similarity (not just string matching)
- LSH/ANN indexing for scalability
- Reduces 68M comparisons to manageable blocks

**Stage 2: Rich Feature Extraction**
- Lexical similarity (multiple algorithms)
- Embedding similarity (semantic understanding)
- **Neighborhood similarity** (graph context - KEY INSIGHT)

**Stage 3: Multi-Class Classification**
- Not just "same/different" but relationship types:
  - owl:sameAs (true duplicates)
  - skos:related (related but distinct)
  - schema:subjectOf (conceptual relationship)

### 1.4 Confidence Recalibration Discovery

Critical finding: **Raw confidence scores are systematically miscalibrated**. The system assigns 0.8 confidence to incorrect facts.

**Solution Architecture:**
1. **Temperature Scaling** - Simple but effective calibration
2. **Topology-Aware Calibration** - GNN-based context sensitivity
3. **Open-World Calibration** - Handles unknown vs. false distinction
4. **Verbalized Confidence** - Direct LLM confidence queries

### 1.5 Relationship Normalization Framework

To handle 837+ raw relationship types collapsing to ~45 canonical:

**4-Level Hierarchy:**
```
Raw (837+) → Domain (~150) → Canonical (45) → Abstract (~15)
"was born in" → BIRTH_LOCATION → bornIn → LOCATION_RELATION
```

**Implementation via:**
- Sentence-BERT embeddings of relationship phrases
- DBSCAN clustering (no predetermined cluster count)
- Hierarchical induction for multi-level organization
- Bidirectional mapping tables for query flexibility

## Part 2: Implementation Priority & Sequencing

### Priority 1: Minimum Viable Refinement (Fix Known Errors)

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
```python
# 1. Structural Validation Pass
class StructuralValidationPass(RefinementPass):
    """Catches Boulder/Lafayette immediately"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.shapes = load_shacl_shapes([
            "located_in_acyclic.ttl",
            "located_in_antisymmetric.ttl",
            "admin_hierarchy_monotone.ttl"
        ])
```

**Week 2-3: Logical Validation**
```python
# 2. Geospatial Validator (Critical for location errors)
class GeospatialValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.geonames_cache = load_geonames_hierarchy()

    def validate_location(self, subj, obj):
        """Boulder (city) cannot be in Lafayette (city)"""
        if get_admin_level(subj) <= get_admin_level(obj):
            return Patch(op="REVERSE_EDGE", confidence=0.95)
```

**Week 3-4: Entity Resolution**
```python
# 3. Lightweight ER with Dedupe
class EntityResolutionPass(RefinementPass):
    def __init__(self):
        self.deduper = dedupe.Dedupe(
            variables=[
                {'field': 'name', 'type': 'String'},
                {'field': 'embedding', 'type': 'Custom',
                 'comparator': cosine_similarity},
                {'field': 'neighbors', 'type': 'Set'}
            ]
        )
```

### Priority 2: Quality & Confidence (Weeks 4-6)

**Confidence Recalibration:**
```python
class ConfidenceCalibrationPass(RefinementPass):
    def execute(self, graph):
        # Temperature scaling on validation set
        validator_scores = collect_validator_outputs(graph)
        temperature = optimize_temperature(validator_scores, labels)

        for triple in graph:
            triple.confidence = sigmoid(triple.raw_score / temperature)
```

**Provenance System:**
```python
class ProvenanceManager:
    def record_change(self, patch: Patch):
        """Every change is auditable"""
        return {
            'id': uuid4(),
            'timestamp': now(),
            'patch': patch,
            'graph_version_before': self.current_version,
            'graph_version_after': self.next_version,
            'validators_agreed': patch.evidence
        }
```

### Priority 3: Advanced Refinement (Weeks 6-12)

**Relationship Normalization:**
- Implement 4-level hierarchy
- Semantic clustering with Sentence-BERT
- Query expansion capabilities

**Enrichment (Link Prediction):**
- Only after cleaning existing data
- TransE/RotatE embeddings
- Conservative threshold (only high-confidence additions)

**Self-Supervised Learning:**
- Graph autoencoders for anomaly detection
- Pattern mining from high-confidence subgraph
- Continuous retraining loop

## Part 3: Metrics Design for Measuring Improvement

### 3.1 Automated Quality Metrics (No Ground Truth Required)

**Logical Consistency Score:**
```python
def logical_consistency_score(graph):
    """Percentage of triples passing all constraints"""
    violations = run_shacl_validation(graph) + run_psl_rules(graph)
    return 1.0 - (len(violations) / len(graph.triples))
```

**Entity Resolution Confidence:**
```python
def er_confidence_score(graph):
    """Quality of entity consolidation"""
    merge_confidences = [m.confidence for m in graph.merge_decisions]
    ambiguity_ratio = len([m for m in merge_confidences if m < 0.7]) / len(merge_confidences)
    return np.mean(merge_confidences), ambiguity_ratio
```

**Relationship Plausibility:**
```python
def relationship_plausibility(graph):
    """Average ensemble validator score"""
    scores = []
    for triple in graph.triples:
        ensemble_score = weighted_average([
            llm_validator.score(triple) * 0.3,
            embedding_validator.score(triple) * 0.3,
            psl_validator.score(triple) * 0.2,
            external_kb_validator.score(triple) * 0.2
        ])
        scores.append(ensemble_score)
    return np.mean(scores)
```

### 3.2 Graph Health Metrics

**Structural Metrics:**
- Density changes (sudden drops indicate problems)
- Clustering coefficient (should be high for real-world domains)
- Centrality distribution (should follow power law)

**Semantic Coherence:**
```python
def semantic_coherence(graph):
    """Average embedding distance between connected entities"""
    distances = []
    for edge in graph.edges:
        dist = cosine_distance(
            get_embedding(edge.source),
            get_embedding(edge.target)
        )
        distances.append(dist)
    return np.mean(distances)  # Should decrease over iterations
```

### 3.3 Convergence Criteria

**Stop refinement when:**
1. Δ(Graph Quality Index) < 0.001 for 2 iterations
2. New patches < 0.1% of graph size
3. All Priority 1 error types eliminated
4. Human spot-check approval > 95%

## Part 4: Critical Implementation Decisions

### 4.1 Technology Stack Recommendations

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **Graph Storage**: Neo4j (property graph) with RDF export capability
- **Validation**: Apache Jena SHACL + custom Python validators
- **Entity Resolution**: Dedupe.io → EAGER (graph-embedding based)
- **Embeddings**: PyKEEN for KGE, Sentence-Transformers for text
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch for custom models
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow for pipeline DAG execution

**External Knowledge:**
- GeoNames API with local cache for geographic validation
- Wikidata SPARQL endpoint for entity verification
- DBpedia for additional context

### 4.2 Handling Edge Cases & Ambiguity

**Geographic Logic (Boulder/Lafayette):**
1. Build complete GeoNames hierarchy cache
2. Admin-level monotonicity check
3. LLM disambiguation for "near" vs. "in"
4. Human review for confidence < 0.8

**Entity Ambiguity (YonEarth variations):**
1. Preserve all surface forms as aliases
2. Choose canonical by: completeness > frequency > external authority
3. Maintain "homonym clusters" for true ambiguity
4. Context features for disambiguation

**Confidence Conflicts:**
- When validators disagree strongly, mark as "disputed"
- Require human review for high-impact disputes
- Learn from human decisions to improve validators

### 4.3 Preventing Oscillations & Ensuring Convergence

**Anti-Oscillation Mechanisms:**
1. **Hysteresis Thresholds**: Different up/down confidence thresholds
2. **Frozen Core**: Top 10% confidence triples are immutable
3. **Change Limits**: Each assertion can only be modified once per cycle unless new evidence
4. **State Hashing**: Detect and break cycles

**Convergence Guarantees:**
```python
class ConvergenceMonitor:
    def should_stop(self, metrics_history):
        # Check multiple criteria
        if len(metrics_history) < 2:
            return False

        delta_gqi = abs(metrics_history[-1].gqi - metrics_history[-2].gqi)
        patches_ratio = metrics_history[-1].patches / metrics_history[-1].graph_size

        return (delta_gqi < 0.001 and patches_ratio < 0.001)
```

## Next Immediate Actions

### Week 1 Sprint:
1. **Monday-Tuesday**: Implement base `RefinementPass` and `Patch` classes
2. **Wednesday**: Write SHACL shapes for location constraints
3. **Thursday**: Build GeoNames validator for Boulder/Lafayette
4. **Friday**: Create first structural validation pass
5. **Weekend**: Test on known errors, measure detection rate

### Success Criteria for Week 1:
- ✅ Detects 100% of location hierarchy errors
- ✅ Generates reversal patches with evidence
- ✅ Full provenance for every change
- ✅ Metrics dashboard showing improvements

### Week 2 Focus:
- Implement LLM validator
- Add embedding-based anomaly detection
- Begin entity resolution with Dedupe
- Establish convergence monitoring

## Conclusion

This synthesis provides a clear path from research to implementation. The system is designed to be:
- **General-purpose**: Works beyond YonEarth
- **Self-improving**: Learns from its own patterns
- **Trustworthy**: Full provenance and evidence
- **Convergent**: Guaranteed to reach stability

The "Boulder LOCATED_IN Lafayette" error will be caught in Week 1 by the structural validation pass with geospatial checking. By Week 12, the system will have evolved into a self-supervising ecosystem that prevents such errors from ever entering the graph.

**Estimated Impact:**
- Error reduction: 95%+
- Query accuracy improvement: 30-50%
- Human validation time: -80%
- Graph quality score: 0.4 → 0.85+

The key is to start with the minimum viable pipeline (Weeks 1-4) that fixes known issues, then progressively add sophistication while maintaining full auditability and measuring improvement at every step.
