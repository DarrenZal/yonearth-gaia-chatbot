# Knowledge Graph Refinement Research Project

## Research Objective

Design and implement a robust, general-purpose knowledge graph refinement system that can iteratively improve the quality, accuracy, and utility of automatically extracted knowledge graphs from any content source (podcasts, books, articles, etc.). The system should be domain-agnostic and capable of detecting and correcting logical errors, inconsistencies, and extraction mistakes through multiple processing passes.

## Current Context

### Project Overview
We have built a knowledge graph extraction system for the YonEarth podcast series (172 episodes) that:
- Uses GPT-4o-mini to extract entities and relationships from transcripts
- Has extracted 11,678 unique entities and 4,220 semantic relationships
- Successfully captured 837+ unique raw relationship types (preserving rich semantic nuance)
- Contains logical errors like "Boulder LOCATED_IN Lafayette" (should be reversed)
- Has entity duplications ("YonEarth" vs "Y on Earth" vs "yonearth community")

### Key Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Hierarchical Relationship Normalization**: Raw (837 types) → Domain (~150 semantic types) → Canonical (45 types) → Abstract (10-15 types)
2. **Emergent Ontology System**: Categories discovered from data using DBSCAN clustering, not predefined
3. **Multi-Modal Embeddings**: Text (OpenAI), Graph (Node2Vec), Relationship (TransE), Temporal
4. **Semantic Domain Layer**: The "brain" for natural language to graph query conversion

### Current Issues Observed
1. **Geographical Logic Errors**: Cities incorrectly contained within smaller cities
2. **Relationship Directionality**: Some relationships have swapped source/target
3. **Entity Resolution**: Same entities with different capitalizations/spellings
4. **Confidence Calibration**: High confidence (0.8) on incorrect relationships
5. **Context Misinterpretation**: AI extracting relationships based on proximity, not actual meaning

## Research Questions

### 1. Multi-Pass Refinement Architecture

**Core Question**: How can we design an iterative refinement pipeline that progressively improves knowledge graph quality without losing information?

**Sub-questions to explore**:
- What should each pass focus on? (e.g., Pass 1: Validation, Pass 2: Correction, Pass 3: Enrichment)
- How do we track changes and maintain provenance across passes?
- Should passes be deterministic or probabilistic?
- How do we prevent refinement loops or oscillations?
- What's the optimal number of passes before diminishing returns?

**Research areas**:
- Graph refinement algorithms from database cleaning literature
- Iterative belief propagation in probabilistic graphical models
- Consensus mechanisms from distributed systems
- Version control strategies for knowledge graphs

### 2. Logical Consistency Validation

**Core Question**: How can we automatically detect and correct logical inconsistencies without domain-specific rules?

**Specific challenges**:
- Detecting impossible relationships (e.g., "California LOCATED_IN Lafayette")
- Identifying contradictions (A contains B, B contains A)
- Recognizing implausible attribute values
- Catching temporal impossibilities

**Approaches to investigate**:
- **Common Sense Reasoning**: Using large language models as common sense validators
- **Constraint Learning**: Automatically learning constraints from correct examples
- **Ensemble Validation**: Multiple models voting on relationship correctness
- **Embedding-Based Validation**: Using embedding space distances to detect anomalies
- **Graph Pattern Mining**: Learning valid subgraph patterns from data

### 3. Entity Resolution at Scale

**Core Question**: How do we accurately merge duplicate entities while preserving legitimate variations?

**Challenges**:
- "YonEarth" vs "Y on Earth" vs "YonEarth Community" (related but different)
- "Dr. Bronner's" vs "Dr. Bronners" vs "Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps" (same company)
- Acronyms: "MIT" vs "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"
- Context-dependent entities: "Boulder" (city) vs "boulder" (rock)

**Research directions**:
- Fuzzy string matching with semantic understanding
- Graph-context-aware entity resolution
- Active learning for ambiguous cases
- Alias management and canonical form selection
- Cross-reference validation using external knowledge bases

### 4. Confidence Recalibration

**Core Question**: How do we adjust extraction confidence scores to reflect actual accuracy?

**Investigation areas**:
- Post-hoc confidence calibration techniques
- Using validation results to train confidence models
- Relationship-type-specific confidence patterns
- Incorporating source reliability and context strength
- Uncertainty quantification in knowledge graphs

### 5. Relationship Type Organization

**Core Question**: How do we best organize and leverage the 837+ naturally-occurring relationship types into a meaningful hierarchy?

**Key considerations**:
- Automatic clustering of semantically similar relationships while preserving uniqueness
- Identifying which domain-specific relationships are most valuable
- Creating a learnable, evolving type hierarchy
- Handling relationship type emergence as new content is processed
- Optimizing mappings between granularity levels for different query needs
- Balancing expressiveness with queryability

### 6. Automated Quality Metrics

**Core Question**: What metrics can automatically assess knowledge graph quality without ground truth?

**Metrics to develop**:
- Logical consistency score
- Entity resolution confidence
- Relationship plausibility score
- Graph structural health metrics
- Semantic coherence measures
- Information density vs. noise ratio

### 7. Self-Supervised Improvement

**Core Question**: Can the knowledge graph improve itself using its own structure and patterns?

**Research avenues**:
- Using high-confidence subgraphs to validate low-confidence ones
- Pattern-based relationship prediction and validation
- Consistency propagation through the graph
- Self-supervised learning from graph structure
- Anomaly detection using graph autoencoders
