# ✅ Knowledge Graph v3.2.2 Implementation Checklist

**Goal**: Production-ready deployment with all blockers fixed
**Status**: ✅ All v3.2.2 release blockers FIXED - ready for testing and deployment
**Version**: 3.2.2 (All Release Blockers Patched)

---

## 🚨 v3.2.2 RELEASE BLOCKERS (FINAL ROUND - ALL FIXED!)

### 1. Dict ↔ Dataclass Mismatch (WILL CRASH)
- [x] **Add to_production_relationship() converter function**
  - [x] Converts dict results from parse_ndjson_response() to ProductionRelationship objects
  - [x] Prevents AttributeError when accessing rel.source, rel.flags, etc.
  - [x] Placed after make_candidate_uid() in code flow
  - [x] Test: Create ProductionRelationship from dict, access attributes

**Impact**: Without this, code crashes with AttributeError when treating dicts as objects ✅ FIXED

### 2. parse_ndjson_response() Object Safety Bug
- [x] **Add _uid_from_item() helper function**
  - [x] Checks isinstance(item, dict) and uses .get() for dicts
  - [x] Uses getattr() for objects
  - [x] Handles both input types safely
  - [x] Test: Pass both dict and object lists, verify no crashes

**Impact**: Without this, calling .get() on objects raises AttributeError ✅ FIXED

### 3. Cache Alignment Bug (DATA CORRUPTION)
- [x] **Fix cache writes in evaluate_batch_robust()**
  - [x] Build uid_to_item mapping from uncached_batch
  - [x] Match results by candidate_uid (not zip order)
  - [x] Only cache when UID matches
  - [x] Test: Verify cache correctness with out-of-order NDJSON results

**Impact**: Without this, wrong results cached to wrong keys when NDJSON is out-of-order ✅ FIXED

### 4. Async Wrapper Signature Bug (CRASHES ON RUN)
- [x] **Fix process_batches_with_concurrency() function**
  - [x] Add required parameters: transcript, model, prompt, prompt_version
  - [x] Use functools.partial to bind parameters
  - [x] Run sync function in thread pool via loop.run_in_executor()
  - [x] Flatten results after gathering
  - [x] Test: Verify async execution without crashes

**Impact**: Without this, async wrapper crashes with missing args and can't await sync function ✅ FIXED

### 🔧 Important Nits (v3.2.2 - Quick Wins Applied)

- [x] **Missing imports added**
  - [x] Added `import re` and `import unicodedata` to imports block
  - [x] All code snippets now have complete import statements

- [x] **Apply geo penalties when validation fails**
  - [x] Extract confidence_penalty from geo_validation result
  - [x] Reduce p_true by penalty amount when valid=False
  - [x] Apply suggested_correction when available

- [x] **Guard None evidence spans in UID generation**
  - [x] Check if start_char or end_char is None
  - [x] Fallback to word indices if available
  - [x] Use hash of evidence_text as last resort
  - [x] Prevents "None" string from appearing in UIDs

- [x] **Unify cache hit-rate math**
  - [x] Use calculate_cache_hit_rate() helper everywhere
  - [x] Guard against divide-by-zero with total > 0 check

- [x] **Quarantine wiring**
  - [x] parse_ndjson_response() accepts quarantine_queue parameter
  - [x] Unmatched candidate_uids logged for audit
  - [x] No silent retries - explicit quarantine handling

- [x] **Complete imports in dataclass snippet**
  - [x] Import Dict, Any in addition to Optional, Literal
  - [x] All typing imports present

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUGS (v3.2.1 - Don't Ship Without These!)

### Mutable Default Bug in Dataclass
- [ ] **Fix all mutable default fields in ProductionRelationship**
  - [ ] Change `evidence: dict = {...}` to `evidence: dict = field(default_factory=_default_evidence)`
  - [ ] Change `audio_timestamp: dict = {...}` to `audio_timestamp: dict = field(default_factory=_default_audio_timestamp)`
  - [ ] Change `extraction_metadata: dict = {...}` to `extraction_metadata: dict = field(default_factory=_default_extraction_metadata)`
  - [ ] Create factory functions: `_default_evidence()`, `_default_audio_timestamp()`, `_default_extraction_metadata()`
  - [ ] Test: Create two instances, modify dict in one, verify other is unchanged

**Impact**: Without this fix, ALL instances share the same dict objects - classic Python gotcha causing state bleeding across edges

### Candidate/Result Joining Bug
- [ ] **Implement candidate_uid echo/join pattern**
  - [ ] Create `make_candidate_uid()` function (hash of source|rel|target|span|doc_sha256)
  - [ ] Assign `candidate.candidate_uid` in Pass-1 for all candidates
  - [ ] Include `candidate_uid` in batch payload sent to Pass-2
  - [ ] Update prompt to instruct: "Return candidate_uid UNCHANGED in every output"
  - [ ] Add `candidate_uid` as first required field in RELATIONSHIP_SCHEMA
  - [ ] Update `parse_ndjson_response()` to build `item_by_uid` map
  - [ ] Join results using `candidate_uid` (not list order)
  - [ ] Attach `obj["_candidate"] = candidate` for flag propagation
  - [ ] Test: Shuffle result order, verify flags still propagate correctly

**Impact**: Without this fix, flags propagation is fragile and breaks with NDJSON partial failures or out-of-order results

### Dataclass Field Ordering Bug
- [ ] **Fix field ordering in ProductionRelationship**
  - [ ] Move all non-default fields (source, relationship, target) FIRST
  - [ ] Give defaults to all other fields (text_confidence = 0.0, pattern_prior = 0.5, etc.)
  - [ ] Ensure no non-default field comes after a defaulted field
  - [ ] Test: Dataclass instantiation doesn't raise TypeError

**Impact**: Python dataclasses require all non-default fields before defaulted fields - this is a runtime TypeError!

### Surface Form Preservation Timing Bug
- [ ] **Fix surface form attachment timing**
  - [ ] Save surface forms BEFORE canonicalization: `src_surface = rel.source`
  - [ ] Canonicalize: `rel.source = alias_resolver.resolve(rel.source)`
  - [ ] Build evidence: `rel.evidence = extract_evidence_with_hash(rel, episode)`
  - [ ] Attach AFTER building: `rel.evidence["source_surface"] = src_surface`
  - [ ] Test: Surface forms preserved after canonicalization

**Impact**: Setting surface forms before extract_evidence_with_hash() overwrites them - they'd always be lost!

### Cache Key Complexity Bug
- [ ] **Simplify scorer_cache_key() to use candidate_uid**
  - [ ] Change from rebuilding source|rel|target|span to just using `candidate_uid`
  - [ ] `cand_uid = getattr(item, "candidate_uid", "")`
  - [ ] `return hashlib.sha1(f"{cand_uid}|{scorer_model}|{prompt_version}".encode()).hexdigest()`
  - [ ] Test: Cache key generation simpler and more collision-proof

**Impact**: candidate_uid already encodes source|rel|target|span|doc_sha256 - simpler is better!

  - [ ] Test: Unknown UIDs logged for investigation

### Telemetry Guards
- [ ] **Add divide-by-zero guard for cache_hit_rate**
  - [ ] Create `calculate_cache_hit_rate()` helper
  - [ ] `return (hits / total) if total > 0 else 0.0`
  - [ ] Test: Works when cache_stats is empty

- [ ] **Add divide-by-zero guard for mean_p_true**
  - [ ] `sum(r.p_true for r in results) / len(results) if results else 0.0`
  - [ ] Test: Works when results is empty

## 🚫 NOT Doing (Avoiding Over-Engineering)

### Won't Implement
- ❌ Full RDF claim reification (using simple temporal fields instead)
- ❌ Complex retrieval system (using simple pattern counting)
- ❌ 500+ edge gold standard (starting with 50-100)
- ❌ Polygon geo validation (distance checks sufficient)
- ❌ Isotonic calibration (simple thresholds work)
- ❌ SHACL for n-ary relationships (current constraints sufficient)
- ❌ Graph-aware entity resolution (alias table catches 80%)

---

## 📅 Timeline

### Week 1 Implementation Plan
- **Days 1-2**: Three-stage extraction with production schema
- **Day 3**: Type validation, geo validation, calibration
- **Day 4**: Review system, caching, performance
- **Day 5**: Acceptance testing and validation
- **Days 6-7**: Full extraction on 172 episodes with monitoring

### Success Criteria
- ✅ 3x more relationships extracted (≥200 per episode)
- ✅ 100% evidence tracking with SHA256 versioning
- ✅ < $6 total extraction cost (with batching + caching)
- ✅ ≤ 20s median review time per edge
- ✅ ECE ≤ 0.07 calibration accuracy
- ✅ 100% idempotent (no duplicates on re-run)

## 📝 Notes

### What We Learned from Testing
- Two-pass extraction gives 3.6x more relationships
- Batching reduces Pass 2 cost by 80%
- Complex prompts overwhelm models (keep them simple)
- Word-level timestamps are our secret weapon

### v3.2.1 Round 4 Critical Bugs Fixed (Runtime Errors)
- **Dataclass field ordering** prevents TypeError at instantiation
- **Surface form timing** preserves original mentions (saved before canonicalization, attached after evidence)
- **Cache key simplified** uses candidate_uid (already stable) instead of rebuilding from components
- **Empty NDJSON lines** skipped gracefully
- **Unknown UIDs quarantined** for audit instead of silent retry
- **Telemetry guards** prevent divide-by-zero errors
- **PostgreSQL-only DDL** prevents portability drift

### v3.2.1 Round 3 Critical Bugs Fixed (State Bleeding)
- **Mutable default bug** all dict fields use default_factory to prevent shared state
- **Candidate/result joining** uses candidate_uid echo pattern (robust against NDJSON failures)

### v3.2.1 Round 2 Final Blockers Fixed (Production-Ready)
- **Scorer-aware caching** prevents stale results when prompts/models change
- **Database unique constraint** prevents duplicates at DB layer (critical safety net)
- **Entity normalization** handles punctuation, accents, spacing variations
- **Concurrency & backoff** prevents rate limit cascades
- **Calibration drift monitoring** detects when model needs re-fit
- **Attribution compliance** for GeoNames/Wikidata
- **Complete Go/No-Go checklist** validates production readiness

### v3.2.1 Review Fixes (Critical consistency updates)
- **Scorer-aware caching** prevents stale cache hits when prompts change
- **Symmetric relations** properly allow Person↔Person for affiliated_with
- **Flags field** enables tracking validation state through pipeline
- **Evidence capping** prevents storage bloat from long context windows
- **Fact UIDs** enable cross-episode analytics separate from claims

### v3.2 Critical Fixes (prevents data loss)
- **Soft type validation** prevents losing 30-40% of unknowns
- **Canonicalize before UID** ensures deduplication works
- **Stable claim UIDs** prevent duplicates on prompt changes
- **Missing data handling** distinguishes unknown from invalid
- **Field consistency** (p_true throughout, no overall_confidence)
- **JSON schema defined** enables actual validation

### v3.1 Production Hardening
- **Type validation between passes** (now soft for unknowns)
- **Admin-aware geo validation** catches edge cases
- **NDJSON** handles partial batch failures gracefully
- **Evidence versioning** handles transcript updates

### What We're Still Skipping
- Full RDF/semantic web complexity
- Polygon-based geo validation
- 500+ edge gold standard (start with 150)
- Industrial ML calibration methods

## 🎯 Remember

**Focus**: Build a production-ready system that won't break, not a perfect theoretical one

**Our Advantages**:
1. Word-level timestamps for all episodes (leverage this hard!)
2. Two-pass approach validated by testing (3.6x coverage)
3. Simple solutions work at our 172-episode scale

**v3.2.1 Philosophy**:
- Don't lose data from overly aggressive filtering (soft validation)
- Ensure deduplication actually works (canonicalize first + DB constraint)
- Make facts stable across iterations (claim UIDs without prompt version)
- Distinguish missing from invalid (explicit None states)
- Be consistent in naming (p_true everywhere)
- Validate before deploying (Go/No-Go checklist)

**The Goal**: A production system that:
- ✅ Preserves all valid data
- ✅ Prevents duplicates at code AND database layers
- ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully
- ✅ Monitors for quality drift
- ✅ Complies with licenses
- ✅ Has been validated before full deployment
