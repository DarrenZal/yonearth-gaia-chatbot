## Summary of Key Themes

### 1. Gaia Personality/Tone
- Multiple users found the tone "too fluffy," "over-the-top new-agey," or "gushy"
- Some users prefer a more neutral, factual voice
- Religious/spiritual framing ("more-than-human") may not resonate with all audiences
- Suggestion: Offer personality options or a more neutral default

### 2. Knowledge Graph UX
- Visual design praised as "impressive" and "innovative"
- UI perceived as too technical for general public users
- Terminology confusing: "entities," "hierarchical clusters," etc.
- **Request**: Guided tour/tutorial for new users
- **Request**: Integration with Gaia chatbot for context-aware navigation

### 3. 3D Podcast Map
- "Cool and innovative" but "overwhelming and confusing"
- Episode dropdown needs more descriptive identifiers (guest names, topics)
- Episodes start at random points instead of the beginning
- Unclear target audience/use case for general public

### 4. Chat Functionality Issues
- Gaia doesn't maintain context when asked follow-up questions about previously recommended episodes
- References episodes without providing clickable links
- Disconnected from Knowledge Graph - users want integration
- Voice pronunciation: "YonEarth" pronounced as "Yawn" (needs spaces: "Y on Earth")

### 5. Voice-to-Text Issues
- "Wele" mistranscribed as "waylay"

## Individual Feedback Responses

### Brianna Wadley (Jan 14, 2026)

**Test Prompt Used:**
> "Hello Gaia, please recommend regenerative practices for a site in Chattahoochee hills Ga that aims to have a edible forest, a youth ranger camp site, trails, a fishing pond, a coy pond, a bamboo forest, and an apiary..."

**Positives:**
- Liked the qualifying questions Gaia provided
- Knowledge graph is a "great visual tool" - easy to see descriptions and access related information

**Issues:**
- "More-than-human" eco-philosophy language initially off-putting (Southern Baptist background)
- Follow-up question about previously recommended episodes resulted in NEW episodes instead of addressing the ones already mentioned
- Voice pronunciation: "YonEarth" pronounced as "Yawn" due to missing spaces

**Suggestions:**
- Add "where to start/how to use" article or virtual tutorial for Knowledge Graph
- Include guidance on factors like centrality, degree, weighted, FPS
- Note device compatibility (phone vs laptop)
- 3D Podcast Map: Episode dropdown needs more descriptive identifiers (guest name, region)
- Episodes should start at beginning, not random points

### Emmanuel M. (Jan 16, 2026)

**Issues:**
- Interface might be overwhelming on first glance

**Suggestions:**
- Integrate Gaia chatbot INTO the knowledge graph
- User prompts chatbot → knowledge graph jumps to relevant node
- Chat provides list of other relevant nodes to explore
- Option to full-screen chat OR show chat alongside knowledge graph
- Show where current conversation topic exists within the knowledge graph

### Caressa Ayres (Jan 18, 2026)

**Chat with Gaia:**
- Substantive information was useful and well-articulated
- **Issue**: Tone "too fluffy" - manner of addressing user was "off-putting"
- Acknowledges some people may like this style, but many won't

**Knowledge Graph:**
- Loves the direction
- **Issue**: UI too technical for average public user
- Problems with: pull-down menus, settings, terminology ("entities," "hierarchical clusters")
- Offered to chat directly for detailed examples

**Semantic Map:**
- Looks amazing and impressive
- **Issue**: Not obvious how general public would use it beyond "random walks"
- Technically-oriented people will understand; others may not

### Frank Biasi (Jan 19, 2026)

**General Observations:**
- Both apps interesting and useful for a "fairly limited audience"

**Gaia Voice:**
- "Over-the-top new-agey, gushy, and flowery"
- Prefers more neutral and factual voice for a content exploration/reference tool
- "Claiming it's THE Voice of Gaia... seems a bit of a rhetorical leap" given it's an AI summarizing limited content

**3D Dashboard:**
- "Kind of cool and interesting"
- **Issues**: "Overwhelming and confusing"
- Unclear who targeted users are
- Acknowledges it's innovative for exploring unstructured knowledge
