## üåü Core Features

### üß† Advanced Category-First RAG System

The chatbot uses a sophisticated hybrid search approach that combines multiple search methods:

#### Search Methods

**1. üåø Original (Semantic Search)**
- Pure meaning-based understanding
- Uses OpenAI embeddings for context
- Best for conceptual questions
- Example: "regenerative practices" matches similar concepts

**2. üîç BM25 (Category-First Hybrid)**
- **Category Matching (60-80%)**: Episodes tagged with relevant categories
- **Semantic Search (15-25%)**: OpenAI embedding similarity
- **Keyword Search (5-15%)**: BM25 term frequency
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: MS-MARCO MiniLM for final relevance
- Best for specific topic queries
- Example: "biochar" matches BIOCHAR category episodes

**3. ‚öñÔ∏è Both (Side-by-Side)**
- Compare results from both methods
- See differences in episode selection
- Helpful for understanding search behavior

#### ‚ú® Semantic Category Matching

TRUE semantic understanding using OpenAI embeddings:

- **Automatic Topic Matching**: "soil" ‚Üí BIOCHAR (32.1% similarity)
- **Cached Embeddings**: Fast performance (`/data/processed/category_embeddings.json`)
- **Configurable Thresholds**:
  - **Broad (0.6)**: Explore creative connections
  - **Normal (0.7)**: Balanced matching (default)
  - **Strict (0.8)**: Only very closely related
  - **Disabled (1.1)**: No category filtering

#### Episode Diversity Algorithm

Ensures all relevant episodes appear, not just one with many chunks:
- Limits chunks per episode in results
- Guarantees episode variety
- Example: All 4 biochar episodes (120, 122, 124, 165) appear for "biochar" queries

## üéØ Smart Conversation Features

### Topic Tracking
- Automatically extracts conversation themes
- Identifies discussed topics
- Updates recommendations dynamically
- Example: "Based on our conversation about: permaculture, soil health..."

### Dynamic Recommendations

**Inline Citations**:
- Episodes referenced in response appear immediately below
- Books cited show chapter and format links

**Recommended Content Section**:
- Shows ALL references from entire conversation
- Evolves as conversation develops
- Prevents duplicate suggestions
- Includes both episodes and books

### Context Evolution
As you chat, recommendations become more relevant:
- Early: General episode suggestions
- Middle: Topic-specific episodes from discussion
- Later: Deep-dive episodes on specific themes

**Example**:
```
User: "What is biochar?"
Gaia: [Explains biochar, cites Episodes 120, 122]

User: "How do I make it?"
Gaia: [Explains process, cites Episode 165]
Recommendations: "Try asking about: other applications of biochar"
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Configurable Search Settings

**Max References (1-10)**
- Controls how many sources cited per response
- Default: 3
- More references = more comprehensive but longer

**Category Threshold**
- Controls semantic category matching strictness
- See "Semantic Category Matching" above

**Search Method**
- Choose Original, BM25, or Both
- Compare different approaches

### Browser Cache-Busting

When updating web files, increment version numbers:
```html
<!-- Old -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=2">

<!-- New (after update) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=3">
```

This forces browsers to load fresh versions instead of cached files.
