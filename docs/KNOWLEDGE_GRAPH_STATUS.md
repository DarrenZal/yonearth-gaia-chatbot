## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Hierarchical Relationship Normalization
```
Raw (837+ types) → Domain (~150 types) → Canonical (45 types) → Abstract (10-15 types)
```
- Preserves nuance while enabling broad queries
- Each level serves different query needs
- No information loss, only organization

### Multi-Modal Approach (Planned)
- **Text Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims)
- **Graph Embeddings**: Node2Vec/GraphSAGE (128-256 dims)
- **Relationship Embeddings**: TransE/RotatE (100-200 dims)
- **Temporal Embeddings**: Episode timestamps

### Emergent Ontology System
- Categories discovered from data using DBSCAN clustering
- Evolves as new content arrives
- No predefined rigid taxonomy
- Learns semantic patterns from actual usage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Scripts

#### Extraction Pipeline
- `extract_all_relationships_comprehensive.py` - Serial extraction with full details
- `extract_relationships_parallel.py` - 3-5x faster parallel extraction
- `run_parallel_extraction.sh` - Wrapper with environment setup

#### Processing & Refinement
- `deduplicate_entities.py` - Entity resolution and merging
- `normalize_relationships.py` - Hierarchical relationship mapping
- `normalize_relationships_semantic.py` - Semantic-aware normalization
- `emergent_ontology.py` - Dynamic category discovery

#### Visualization
- `export_visualization.py` - Generates D3.js compatible JSON
- Web interface at https://earthdo.me/KnowledgeGraph.html

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Logical Errors in Extraction
**Example**: "Boulder LOCATED_IN Lafayette" (backwards)
**Cause**: AI misinterpretation of geographical relationships
**Status**: Identified, refinement system in development
**Solution**: Multi-pass validation with LLM common sense checking

### Issue 2: Entity Variations
**Example**: "YonEarth" vs "Y on Earth" vs "yonearth community"
**Cause**: Natural language variations in transcripts
**Status**: Partially resolved with deduplication
**Solution**: Canonical entity mapping with alias preservation

### Issue 3: Confidence Calibration
**Example**: High confidence (0.8) on incorrect relationships
**Cause**: GPT-4 overconfidence on extracted relationships
**Status**: Under investigation
**Solution**: Post-hoc calibration based on validation results

## 🚀 Next Steps
