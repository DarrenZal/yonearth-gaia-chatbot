Rules: 1) If relationship is 'authored', check target length (flag if <3 words unless it's a known single-word title like 'Dune'). 2) Check for incomplete patterns: ends with comma, starts with lowercase, ends with 'and'. 3) If INCOMPLETE_TITLE flag is set AND split_index exists, attempt to reconstruct original from split metadata. 4) Run before final output."
