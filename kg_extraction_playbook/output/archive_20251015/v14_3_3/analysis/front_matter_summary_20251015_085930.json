      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "type": "CONFIG_UPDATE",
      "recommendation": "Add exemption rules for figurative language detection: (1) Skip analysis when target entity is a Book title, Organization name, or other proper noun, (2) Add context-aware rules that recognize when metaphorical terms are part of names vs. claims about reality."

    {
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "type": "CODE_FIX",
      "recommendation": "Add predicate-based exemptions for opinion detection. Predicates like 'stated', 'believes', 'quoted', 'attributed', 'claimed' describe factual speech acts, not opinions.
