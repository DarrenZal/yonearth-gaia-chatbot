Evaluate these {batch_size} extracted relationships using dual-signal analysis.

RELATIONSHIPS TO EVALUATE:
{relationships_json}

For EACH of the {batch_size} relationships above, provide TWO INDEPENDENT evaluations:

1. TEXT SIGNAL (ignore world knowledge):
   - How clearly does the text state this relationship?
   - Score 0.0-1.0 based purely on text clarity

2. KNOWLEDGE SIGNAL (ignore the text):
   - Is this relationship plausible given world knowledge?
   - What types are the source and target entities?
   - Score 0.0-1.0 based purely on plausibility

If the signals conflict:
- Set signals_conflict = true
- Include conflict_explanation
- Include suggested_correction if known

CRITICAL: Return candidate_uid UNCHANGED in every output object.

Evaluate all {batch_size} relationships in the same order as input.
