Extract ALL meaningful relationships from this text - including factual, philosophical, and metaphorical statements.

## ⚠️ EXTRACTION GUIDELINES ⚠️

**EXTRACT (Be comprehensive)**:
✅ Factual relationships (authorship, organizational, causal)
✅ Testable claims (even without evidence present)
✅ Philosophical statements and opinions
✅ Metaphors and figurative language
✅ Abstract concepts and ideas
✅ All types of discourse (claims, evidence, questions)

**IMPORTANT - Entity Quality**:
⚠️ Try to resolve pronouns to specific entities when context allows
⚠️ Keep entities concise (2-5 words typically)
⚠️ Note: We'll classify and flag different statement types in later passes

## 📏 ENTITY CONCISENESS

Entities should be **CONCISE NOUN PHRASES** (2-5 words typically):

✅ GOOD: "soil ecosystem complexity"
❌ BAD: "hardly anything is as complex as the living web of interconnectedness found in our planet's soil"

✅ GOOD: "new generation of farmers"
❌ BAD: "new generation of farmers, gardeners and citizens are leading the way"

✅ GOOD: "biochar production methods"
❌ BAD: "the various methods and techniques used for biochar production"

## 📚 FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Resolve Pronouns When Possible
**Text**: "I hail from Slovenia. My people have lived there for centuries."
✅ BETTER: (Aaron William Perry, hails from, Slovenia)
✅ BETTER: (Slovenians, lived in, Slovenia)
⚠️ ACCEPTABLE IF CONTEXT UNCLEAR: (I, hails from, Slovenia) [will be flagged for review]

**Why**: Try to resolve pronouns using context, but extract even if resolution isn't clear.

### Example 2: Extract Philosophical Statements
**Text**: "Being connected to land and soil is what it means to be human."
✅ EXTRACT: (being connected to land and soil, is what it means to be, human)

**Why**: This is a philosophical claim that's part of the discourse. It will be flagged as PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM in Pass 2.

### Example 3: Extract Abstract Concepts
**Text**: "Spiritual flourishing is wedded to how we take care of the earth."
✅ EXTRACT: (spiritual flourishing, depends on, earth care)

**Why**: Abstract concepts are valid discourse. They'll be classified appropriately in Pass 2.

### Example 4: Keep Entities Concise
**Text**: "Learning about soil and engaging in soil-building practices is an exciting way to positively influence families."
✅ GOOD: (soil education, benefits, families)
⚠️ ACCEPTABLE: (learning about soil, benefits, families) [slightly verbose but extractable]

**Why**: Prefer concise noun phrases, but extract even if entities are somewhat verbose.

### Example 5: Extract Metaphors
**Text**: "Our land has remained a veritable Eden through the ages."
✅ EXTRACT: (our land, is, veritable Eden)

**Why**: Metaphors are meaningful discourse. They'll be flagged as METAPHOR in Pass 2.5.

## ⚠️ PROHIBITED RELATIONSHIP TYPES - DO NOT EXTRACT

❌ Metaphorical statements: 'X unlocks Y', 'X is the key to Y', 'X opens the door to Y'
❌ Philosophical claims: 'X is the answer', 'X is the way', 'X is the solution'
❌ Subjective opinions: 'X is beautiful', 'X is inspiring', 'X is transformative'
❌ Motivational language: 'X empowers us to Y', 'X invites us to Y'
✅ INSTEAD: Extract only concrete, testable, factual relationships

### Examples of What NOT to Extract:

❌ BAD: (soil, is, the answer) - philosophical/metaphorical
✅ GOOD: (soil, contains, microorganisms) - factual, testable

❌ BAD: (cultivating relationship with soil, unlocks, spiritual growth) - metaphorical + subjective
✅ GOOD: (soil management practices, improve, crop yields) - factual, measurable

❌ BAD: (Soil Stewardship Handbook, provides, road-map) - metaphor
✅ GOOD: (Soil Stewardship Handbook, contains, 12 chapters) - factual

❌ BAD: (regenerative agriculture, is, transformative) - subjective opinion
✅ GOOD: (regenerative agriculture, increases, soil carbon) - measurable

❌ BAD: (soil stewardship, empowers, communities) - motivational language
✅ GOOD: (soil stewardship programs, train, 500 farmers) - concrete action

❌ BAD: (composting, opens doors to, sustainability) - metaphorical
✅ GOOD: (composting, reduces, waste volume) - measurable outcome

**INSTRUCTION**: If a statement is primarily inspirational, motivational, or philosophical, DO NOT extract it. Focus on concrete facts, actions, and measurable relationships.

{text}

## ⚡ BE COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE

Extract relationships that are:
- Clearly stated or strongly implied in the text

- Useful for building a complete knowledge graph
- Using concise entities (2-5 words preferred)

Quality tips:
- Try to resolve pronouns when context allows
- Keep entities concise but don't skip extraction if unsure
- Extract ALL types of statements - classification happens in Pass 2
- When in doubt, extract it - we prefer completeness over filtering
