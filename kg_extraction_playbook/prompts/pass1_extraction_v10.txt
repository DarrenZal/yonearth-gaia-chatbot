## ⚠️ ENTITY QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

### Specificity (CRITICAL)
❌ **AVOID VAGUE ENTITIES**:
- "thousands" → ✅ "thousands of people"
- "millions" → ✅ "millions of humans"
- "the land" → ✅ "agricultural land" or "Slovenia" (be specific)
- "the sea" → ✅ "ocean ecosystems" or "Mediterranean Sea" (be specific)
- "it" → ✅ Resolve to specific entity from context
- "they" → ✅ Resolve to specific group from context

### Conciseness
✅ **KEEP ENTITIES CONCISE** (2-5 words typically):
- ✅ GOOD: "soil ecosystem complexity"
- ❌ BAD: "hardly anything is as complex as the living web of interconnectedness found in our planet's soil"

### Pronoun Resolution
✅ **RESOLVE PRONOUNS** when context allows:
- "I hail from Slovenia. My people love the land."
  - ✅ BETTER: (Aaron William Perry, hails from, Slovenia)
  - ✅ BETTER: (Slovenians, love, agricultural land)
  - ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE IF UNCLEAR: (my people, love, the land) [will be flagged]

### Entity Specificity Principle
Always prefer SPECIFIC, CONTEXTUALIZED entities over GENERIC ones. Use document context (geographic setting, domain, author background) to add precision.

**Examples of Specific vs. Generic Entities**:
- ✅ "Slovenian countryside" > ❌ "the land"
- ✅ "atmospheric carbon dioxide" > ❌ "carbon"
- ✅ "regenerative agriculture practices" > ❌ "farming"
- ✅ "Bill Mollison's permaculture system" > ❌ "the system"
- ✅ "soil microbiome" > ❌ "microorganisms"

**Instruction**: When you encounter generic references ("the land", "the process", "the answer"), look at surrounding context to identify the specific entity being referenced. If context is insufficient, skip the relationship rather than extract a vague entity.

## ⚠️ PROHIBITED STATEMENT TYPES

DO NOT extract philosophical, normative, or metaphorical statements as factual relationships. ONLY extract verifiable factual claims.

**Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Philosophical essence claims: 'X is what it means to be Y'
- ❌ Normative prescriptions: 'we should/must do X', 'it is essential that'
- ❌ Metaphorical abstractions: 'X is the answer/key/solution'
- ❌ Rhetorical constructions: 'X opens doors to Y', 'X is a crossroads'
- ❌ Value judgments: 'X is beautiful/important/essential'

**Examples**:
- ❌ REJECT: 'being connected to land is what it means to be human' (philosophical claim about human nature)
- ❌ REJECT: 'soil is the answer' (metaphorical abstraction)
- ❌ REJECT: 'we must regenerate the soil' (normative prescription)
- ✅ ACCEPT: 'soil contains organic matter' (verifiable fact)
- ✅ ACCEPT: 'regenerative agriculture increases soil carbon' (verifiable causal claim)

## ⚠️ FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE HANDLING

DO NOT extract metaphorical statements as literal facts. If a statement is clearly figurative, either SKIP it or extract the underlying literal claim if unambiguous.

### Common Metaphor Patterns to AVOID:
- ❌ 'X is a Y' where Y is figurative: Eden, paradise, crossroads, miracle, answer, key, door, journey, treasure, gold mine
- ❌ 'X opens doors to Y' (metaphor for enabling/opportunity)
- ❌ 'X is the key to Y' (metaphor for importance/solution)
- ❌ 'X is a journey' (metaphor for process/experience)
- ❌ 'X is the heart of Y' (metaphor for centrality)
- ❌ 'X is a bridge to Y' (metaphor for connection)
- ❌ 'X is the foundation of Y' (metaphor for importance) - UNLESS literally structural
- ❌ 'X is a window into Y' (metaphor for insight)

### Metaphor Recognition Examples:

**SKIP - Pure Metaphor**:
- ❌ "Our land is a veritable Eden" (metaphor for beauty/abundance)
- ❌ "We are at a crossroads" (metaphor for decision point)
- ❌ "Soil is the answer to climate change" (metaphor for solution)
- ❌ "This opens doors to new possibilities" (metaphor for enabling)
- ❌ "Knowledge is a treasure" (metaphor for value)

**EXTRACT LITERAL - Clear Underlying Fact**:
- ✅ "Soil is the foundation of agriculture" → (soil, supports, agriculture) [literal dependency]
- ✅ "Trees provide oxygen" → (trees, produce, oxygen) [literal process]
- ✅ "Roots anchor plants in soil" → (roots, anchor, plants in soil) [literal function]

**SKIP - Ambiguous/Unclear**:
- ❌ "Regeneration is a journey we must take together" (metaphorical framing)
- ❌ "This practice is the key to success" (vague metaphor)

### Decision Framework:
1. **Is the statement using figurative/poetic language?** → SKIP
2. **Does 'X is Y' use Y as a metaphor (Eden, key, answer, journey)?** → SKIP
3. **Can you extract a clear, testable, literal claim?** → EXTRACT
4. **When in doubt about metaphor vs. literal?** → SKIP (err on side of caution)

## 📖 TEXT TO EXTRACT FROM

{text}

## ⚡ BE COMPREHENSIVE, SPECIFIC, AND ACCURATE

Extract relationships that are:
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE**: Extract ALL valuable factual relationships (bibliographic, categorical, compositional, functional, organizational)
- ✅ **SPECIFIC**: Avoid vague entities ("thousands" → "thousands of people", "the land" → "agricultural land")
- ✅ **ACCURATE**: Clearly stated or strongly implied in the text
- ✅ **MEANINGFUL**: Useful for building a complete general knowledge graph (not discourse graph)
- ✅ **CONCISE**: Use 2-5 word entities when possible
- ✅ **FACTUAL**: Verifiable claims only - NO philosophical, normative, or metaphorical statements
- ✅ **LITERAL**: Skip figurative language unless clear literal claim can be extracted

**PRIORITY**: Bibliographic citations, categorical definitions, compositional relationships, functional relationships, and organizational affiliations are HIGH VALUE. Extract ALL of them.

**QUALITY TIPS**:
- Resolve pronouns to specific entities when context allows
- Be specific with determiners and quantifiers ("the land" → "agricultural land")
- Extract ONLY factual, verifiable statements - REJECT philosophical/normative/metaphorical claims
- SKIP figurative language (Eden, crossroads, opens doors, is the key, etc.)
- When in doubt about factuality or metaphor, DO NOT extract
- Bibliographic citations are NOT "too simple" - they are ESSENTIAL knowledge graph elements
