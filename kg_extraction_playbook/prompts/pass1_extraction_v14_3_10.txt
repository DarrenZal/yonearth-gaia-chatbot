Extract graph-ready relationships from the TEXT below.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with a single top-level key "relationships" and nothing else.

Schema (strict):
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": string,
      "relationship": string,
      "target": string,
      "source_type": "PERSON"|"ORGANIZATION"|"BOOK"|"CONCEPT"|"PLACE"|"MATERIAL"|"PROCESS"|"SECTION",
      "target_type": "PERSON"|"ORGANIZATION"|"BOOK"|"CONCEPT"|"PLACE"|"MATERIAL"|"PROCESS"|"STATEMENT"|"QUOTE",
      "context": string,
      "page": 0
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Capture factual AND attributable content present in the text.
- Prefer named entities over vague pronouns; avoid generic sources/targets (we, they, people) unless clearly resolved.
- Canonical predicates to use when applicable: authored, published, said, poses question, defined, is-a, includes, has, founded, launched, located in.
- Quotes: PERSON → said → QUOTE (target_type=QUOTE); keep minimal quote span (<= 240 chars).
- Questions: AUTHOR/SECTION → poses question → STATEMENT (target_type=STATEMENT).
- Case-study facts: For organizations mentioned (e.g., banks, funds, programs), extract concrete facts (type, launch year, notable descriptors) using predicates like is-a, launched, founded, located in.
- Market stats: Extract sector metrics and shares using predicates like has (annual sales/revenue) and includes (share of population/participants). Normalize numbers (e.g., “half a trillion dollars” → “$500 billion”).
- Social posts/articles: For attributions like “X posted on LinkedIn,” use published as the predicate and target_type=ARTICLE with a concise description (e.g., “LinkedIn post about …”).
- Definitions/identity: Only when explicit in text; avoid philosophical comparisons as facts.
- If nothing valid, return {"relationships": []}.
