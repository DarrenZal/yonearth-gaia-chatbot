Extract ALL meaningful relationships from this text - including factual, philosophical, and metaphorical statements.

## ⚠️ EXTRACTION GUIDELINES ⚠️

**EXTRACT (Be comprehensive)**:
✅ Factual relationships (authorship, organizational, causal)
✅ Testable claims (even without evidence present)
✅ Philosophical statements and opinions
✅ Metaphors and figurative language
✅ Abstract concepts and ideas
✅ All types of discourse (claims, evidence, questions)

**IMPORTANT - Entity Quality**:
⚠️ Try to resolve pronouns to specific entities when context allows
⚠️ Keep entities concise (2-5 words typically)
⚠️ Note: We'll classify and flag different statement types in later passes

## 📏 ENTITY CONCISENESS

Entities should be **CONCISE NOUN PHRASES** (2-5 words typically):

✅ GOOD: "soil ecosystem complexity"
❌ BAD: "hardly anything is as complex as the living web of interconnectedness found in our planet's soil"

✅ GOOD: "new generation of farmers"
❌ BAD: "new generation of farmers, gardeners and citizens are leading the way"

✅ GOOD: "biochar production methods"
❌ BAD: "the various methods and techniques used for biochar production"

## 🎯 ENTITY SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS

**Before extracting any entity, ask: "Is this entity specific and named, or is it a pronoun/vague reference?" If vague, look for the specific referent in surrounding context.**

### Prohibited Vague Patterns:

❌ NEVER use possessive pronouns as entities: "my people", "our tradition", "their practices", "his work"
❌ NEVER use demonstrative pronouns: "this", "that", "these", "those", "this handbook"
❌ NEVER use vague abstractions: "the answer", "the way", "the solution", "salient insights", "millions of people"

✅ ALWAYS resolve pronouns to specific named entities from context
✅ PREFER specific named entities: "Slovenians" not "my people", "Soil Stewardship Handbook" not "this handbook"

### Specificity Examples:

❌ BAD: (my people, love, the land)
**Why**: "my people" is a possessive pronoun
✅ GOOD: (Slovenians, love, the land)
**Why**: Specific named ethnic group

❌ BAD: (this handbook, provides, salient insights)
**Why**: "this handbook" uses demonstrative pronoun, "salient insights" is vague
✅ GOOD: (Soil Stewardship Handbook, provides, soil management techniques)
**Why**: Specific named document and concrete techniques

❌ BAD: (Y on Earth Community, collaborates with, millions of people)
**Why**: "millions of people" is a vague quantifier
✅ GOOD: (Y on Earth Community, collaborates with, local farming cooperatives)
**Why**: Specific type of organization

❌ BAD: (the answer, lies in, regenerative agriculture)
**Why**: "the answer" is an abstract placeholder
✅ GOOD: (soil carbon sequestration, depends on, regenerative agriculture)
**Why**: Specific process named

❌ BAD: (their practices, improve, soil health)
**Why**: "their practices" uses possessive pronoun
✅ GOOD: (indigenous farming practices, improve, soil health)
**Why**: Specific type of practices identified

## 📚 FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Resolve Pronouns When Possible
**Text**: "I hail from Slovenia. My people have lived there for centuries."
✅ BETTER: (Aaron William Perry, hails from, Slovenia)
✅ BETTER: (Slovenians, lived in, Slovenia)
⚠️ ACCEPTABLE IF CONTEXT UNCLEAR: (I, hails from, Slovenia) [will be flagged for review]

**Why**: Try to resolve pronouns using context, but extract even if resolution isn't clear.

### Example 2: Extract Philosophical Statements
**Text**: "Being connected to land and soil is what it means to be human."
✅ EXTRACT: (being connected to land and soil, is what it means to be, human)

**Why**: This is a philosophical claim that's part of the discourse. It will be flagged as PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM in Pass 2.

### Example 3: Extract Abstract Concepts
**Text**: "Spiritual flourishing is wedded to how we take care of the earth."
✅ EXTRACT: (spiritual flourishing, depends on, earth care)

**Why**: Abstract concepts are valid discourse. They'll be classified appropriately in Pass 2.

### Example 4: Keep Entities Concise
**Text**: "Learning about soil and engaging in soil-building practices is an exciting way to positively influence families."
✅ GOOD: (soil education, benefits, families)
⚠️ ACCEPTABLE: (learning about soil, benefits, families) [slightly verbose but extractable]

**Why**: Prefer concise noun phrases, but extract even if entities are somewhat verbose.

### Example 5: Extract Metaphors
**Text**: "Our land has remained a veritable Eden through the ages."
✅ EXTRACT: (our land, is, veritable Eden)

**Why**: Metaphors are meaningful discourse. They'll be flagged as METAPHOR in Pass 2.5.

## 📚 RELATIONSHIP TYPES TO EXTRACT

### 1. ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS
- **Authorship**: X authored Y, X wrote Y, X published Y
- **Organizational**: X founded Y, X works for Y, X is affiliated with Y
- **Location**: X is located in Y, X occurs in Y
- **Attribution**: X said Y, X stated Y, X believes Y

### ⚠️ AUTHORSHIP VS ENDORSEMENT - CRITICAL DISTINCTION

**This is a common error - read carefully:**

✅ **'authored'**: Use when text explicitly states X wrote/created Y
- Evidence indicators: 'Copyright by X', 'Written by X', 'X is the author of Y', 'By X'
- Examples:
  - ✅ 'Copyright © 2018 Aaron Perry' → (Aaron Perry, authored, Soil Stewardship Handbook)
  - ✅ 'Written by John Smith' → (John Smith, authored, [book title])
  - ✅ 'By Maria Garcia' → (Maria Garcia, authored, [article title])

✅ **'endorsed'**: Use when X praises/recommends Y
- Evidence indicators: 'X says Y is excellent', 'X recommends Y', testimonial quotes, praise language ('inspiring', 'wonderful', 'brilliant')
- Examples:
  - ✅ 'Brigitte Mars says: This handbook is an excellent tool' → (Brigitte Mars, endorsed, Soil Stewardship Handbook)
  - ✅ 'With Love and Hope, Lily Sophia' at end of foreword → (Lily Sophia, wrote foreword for, Soil Stewardship Handbook)
  - ✅ 'Dr. Smith recommends this approach for all farmers' → (Dr. Smith, endorsed, [approach name])
  - ✅ 'An inspiring guide - Jane Doe' → (Jane Doe, endorsed, [guide name])

❌ **WRONG**: Using 'authored' for testimonial quotes
- ❌ 'This is excellent - John' → (John, authored, [book]) **WRONG**
- ✅ 'This is excellent - John' → (John, endorsed, [book]) **CORRECT**

**Decision Rule**: If text contains praise language ('excellent', 'inspiring', 'recommends', 'wonderful', 'brilliant', 'love this') or is a testimonial/review quote, use 'endorsed' NOT 'authored'. Only use 'authored' for explicit creation/copyright statements.

**Additional authorship-related predicates**:
- **'wrote foreword for'**: When X writes introductory material for Y
- **'contributed to'**: When X provides content but isn't primary author
- **'edited'**: When X edits Y

### 2. DISCOURSE GRAPH (MODULAR & COMPOSABLE)
- **Claims**: ANY assertion, argument, or statement (factual, philosophical, metaphorical)
  - Extract claims even without supporting evidence
  - Claims can be connected to evidence later (modular design)
  - Include testable claims, opinions, philosophical statements
- **Evidence**: Facts, data, observations that support or oppose claims
- **Questions**: Specific inquiries, problems, challenges posed
- Relationships:
  - Claim → supports → Claim
  - Claim → opposes → Claim
  - Evidence → supports → Claim
  - Evidence → opposes → Claim
  - Claim → answers → Question

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: Extract all discourse elements. Classification happens in Pass 2.

### 3. PROCESSES & PRACTICES
- **Methods**: X involves Y, X requires Y, X includes Y, X produces Y
- **Procedures**: X transforms Y, X creates Y, X converts Y into Z
- **Practices**: X recommends Y, X suggests Y, X implements Y

**Focus on**: Concrete, repeatable processes with specific entities.

### 4. CAUSATION & EFFECTS
- **Positive**: X causes Y, X leads to Y, X enables Y, X improves Y
- **Negative**: X prevents Y, X harms Y, X destroys Y, X threatens Y
- **Neutral**: X affects Y, X influences Y, X changes Y

**Extract all causal relationships**: Including speculative, philosophical, and factual causation.

### 5. DEFINITIONS & DESCRIPTIONS
- **Identity**: X is-a Y, X is defined as Y (including metaphorical identities)
- **Properties**: X has Y, X contains Y, X exhibits Y
- **Comparison**: X is similar to Y, X differs from Y

**Extract all definitions**: Including literal, metaphorical, and philosophical definitions.

### 6. QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS
- **Measurements**: X measures Y units, X equals Y percent
- **Changes**: X increases by Y, X decreases by Y
- **Comparisons**: X is greater than Y, X is equivalent to Y

## 📝 OUTPUT FORMAT

For each relationship provide:
- **source**: Concise source entity (2-5 words, no pronouns)
- **relationship**: Relationship type (supports, causes, is-a, produces, authored, endorsed, etc.)
- **target**: Concise target entity (2-5 words, no pronouns)
- **evidence_text**: Quote from text (100-300 characters)

## 📖 TEXT TO EXTRACT FROM

{text}

## ⚡ BE COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE

Extract relationships that are:
- Clearly stated or strongly implied in the text
- Meaningful discourse elements (factual, philosophical, metaphorical, all types)
- Useful for building a complete knowledge graph
- Using concise entities (2-5 words preferred)
- Using correct predicates (especially 'authored' vs 'endorsed')

Quality tips:
- Try to resolve pronouns when context allows
- Keep entities concise but don't skip extraction if unsure
- Extract ALL types of statements - classification happens in Pass 2
- When in doubt, extract it - we prefer completeness over filtering
- **CRITICAL**: Check for authorship vs endorsement - testimonials and praise quotes use 'endorsed', NOT 'authored'
