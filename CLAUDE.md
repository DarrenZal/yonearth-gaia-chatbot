### Data Processing

#### Episode Processing Workflow

**Process all episodes from transcript files:**
```bash
# Process all 172 episodes
EPISODES_TO_PROCESS=172 python3 -m src.ingestion.process_episodes

# Process subset of episodes (for testing)
EPISODES_TO_PROCESS=20 python3 -m src.ingestion.process_episodes
```

**Episode Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Load transcripts** from `/data/transcripts/episode_*.json`
2. **Validate episodes** (must have transcripts > 100 characters)
3. **Extract metadata** (episode number, title, guest, dates, URLs)
4. **Chunk transcripts** into 500-token segments with 50-token overlap
5. **Generate vector embeddings** using OpenAI
6. **Store in Pinecone** vector database with episode metadata
7. **Save metadata** to `/data/processed/episode_metadata.json`
8. **Create BM25 index** for keyword-based search

#### Book Processing Workflow

**Process all books from PDF files:**
```bash
# Process all books in /data/books directory
python3 -m src.ingestion.process_books

# Individual book processing functions available:
# process_books_for_ingestion() - Extract and chunk book content
# add_books_to_vectorstore() - Add to Pinecone vector database
```

**Book Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Load PDFs** from `/data/books/*/metadata.json` and corresponding PDF files
2. **Extract text** using pdfplumber for clean PDF text extraction
3. **Detect chapters** using intelligent regex patterns for various chapter formats
4. **Extract metadata** (title, author, publication info from metadata.json)
5. **Chunk content** into 750-token segments with 100-token overlap (larger than episodes)
6. **Generate vector embeddings** using OpenAI
7. **Store in Pinecone** vector database with book metadata (content_type: 'book')
8. **Update BM25 index** to include book content for keyword-based search

**Important Notes:**
- **Episode location**: Episodes must be in `/data/transcripts/` directory  
- **Episode format**: JSON files with `full_transcript` field
- **Episode processing time**: ~172 episodes takes 5-10 minutes depending on API limits
- **Episode output**: Creates 14,000+ text chunks ready for RAG search
- **Book location**: Books must be in `/data/books/book_name/` directory structure
- **Book format**: PDF files with corresponding `metadata.json` file
- **Book processing time**: Depends on book size (~2,000 chunks for 568-page book)
- **Book output**: Creates book chunks with chapter-level metadata for precise citations

**Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Check episode count
find /root/yonearth-gaia-chatbot/data/transcripts -name "*.json" | wc -l

# Verify processed episodes
cat /root/yonearth-gaia-chatbot/data/processed/episode_metadata.json | jq '.episode_count'

# Check book count and structure
find /root/yonearth-gaia-chatbot/data/books -name "*.pdf" | wc -l
find /root/yonearth-gaia-chatbot/data/books -name "metadata.json"

# Verify vector database contains both episodes and books
# Current total: 18,764+ vectors (episodes + books combined)

# Test specific components
python scripts/test_api.py
```

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Set `PINECONE_API_KEY` environment variable
- Ensure Pinecone index `yonearth-episodes` exists (1536 dimensions, cosine metric)

### Dual Search Architecture

The system provides two complementary RAG approaches:

#### üåø Original RAG (Semantic + Keyword Hybrid)
1. **Keyword Indexer**: Builds frequency maps of important terms across episodes
2. **Semantic Search**: Vector similarity search using OpenAI embeddings  
3. **Hybrid Retriever**: Combines both approaches with weighted scoring
4. **Citation Accuracy**: Solves hallucination by finding episodes that actually contain search terms

#### üîç BM25 Advanced RAG (Category-First with Semantic Matching)
1. **Episode Categorization**: CSV-based topic tagging from tracking sheet (`/data/PodcastPipelineTracking.csv`)
2. **‚ú® Semantic Category Matching**: TRUE semantic understanding using OpenAI embeddings
   - Category embeddings cached in `/data/processed/category_embeddings.json`
   - Query embeddings compared via cosine similarity
   - Solves "soil" ‚Üí BIOCHAR matching (32.1% similarity)
   - Configurable thresholds: Broad (0.6), Normal (0.7), Strict (0.8), Disabled (1.1)
3. **Category-First Search**: Prioritizes episodes with matching categories (60-80% weight)
4. **BM25 Keyword Search**: Industry-standard keyword matching (15% weight)
5. **Semantic Vector Search**: OpenAI embedding similarity (25% weight)
6. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: MS-MARCO MiniLM final relevance scoring
7. **‚ú® Episode Diversity Algorithm**: Ensures all relevant episodes appear, not just one with many chunks

**Current Search Weights**:
- Category match: 60% (increases to 80% for category-heavy queries)
- Semantic similarity: 25% (decreases to 15% for category-heavy queries)
- BM25 keyword: 15% (decreases to 5% for category-heavy queries)

### Smart Web Interface Features

**Personality System**:
- 3 predefined personalities (Nurturing Mother, Ancient Sage, Earth Guardian)
- Custom personality creation with editable system prompts
- localStorage persistence for custom prompts
- Template-based editing using existing personalities

**Search Method Selection**:
- üåø Original (Semantic Search): Meaning-based context understanding  
- üîç BM25 (Hybrid Search): Keyword + semantic + reranking
- ‚öñÔ∏è Both (Comparison): Side-by-side results from both methods

**‚ú® Category Matching Controls**:
- **Broad (0.6)**: Explore connections like "dirt" ‚Üí "biochar"
- **Normal (0.7)**: Balanced matching (default)
- **Strict (0.8)**: Only very closely related categories
- **Disabled (1.1)**: No category filtering - search all content

**Voice Features**:
- **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs integration with custom voice
- **Voice Toggle**: Speaker button to enable/disable voice

**Styling**: Update `web/styles.css` for visual changes

**HTML Structure**: Modify `web/index.html` for new UI components

### Testing Search Accuracy
Both RAG systems are designed to solve the citation hallucination problem. Test with queries like:
- "what is biochar?" ‚Üí Should return Episodes 120, 122, 165
- "regenerative agriculture" ‚Üí Should return relevant farming episodes
- "composting techniques" ‚Üí Should return composting-focused episodes
- "what is the significance of chlorophyll and hemoglobin?" ‚Üí Should return VIRIDITAS book content
- "tell me about chapter 30 where Gaia speaks in VIRIDITAS" ‚Üí Should correctly reference Chapter 30: Gaia Speaks
- "what are soil building parties?" ‚Üí Should return Soil Stewardship Handbook references
- "how can I live more sustainably?" ‚Üí Should return Y on Earth book content

### Recent Fixes and Improvements

**Book Chapter Reference Fix (2025-07-03)**:
- **Issue**: Book metadata contained page numbers instead of actual chapter numbers, causing incorrect citations
- **Solution**: Implemented chapter mapping logic that converts page numbers to actual chapter numbers using the book's table of contents
- **Result**: VIRIDITAS book now correctly shows "Chapter 30: Gaia Speaks" instead of wrong page numbers
- **Affected Methods**: `_extract_episode_references`, `_format_sources`, `search_episodes`, and `_format_comparison_result` in `bm25_chain.py`

## Deployment Notes

- **VPS**: Use `./deploy.sh` for complete Docker setup with nginx, SSL, Redis

## ‚úÖ Recent Major Improvements (July 2025)

### Recently Resolved Issues

1. ‚úÖ **Episode Diversity Problem**: SOLVED with `diverse_episode_search()` algorithm
   - **Was**: Category search returned many chunks from episode 120 instead of all 4 biochar episodes
   - **Fixed**: Now ensures all relevant episodes (120, 122, 124, 165) appear in results
   - **Implementation**: Limits chunks per episode and guarantees diversity

2. ‚úÖ **Semantic Category Matching**: SOLVED with OpenAI embeddings
   - **Was**: Episode 124 categorized as BIOCHAR but keyword "biochar" not in transcript  
   - **Fixed**: "soil" queries now match BIOCHAR category (32.1% similarity)
   - **Implementation**: True semantic understanding via cosine similarity

3. ‚úÖ **Category Threshold Configuration**: IMPLEMENTED in UI
   - **Was**: Fixed thresholds, no user control
   - **Fixed**: User-configurable thresholds (Broad/Normal/Strict/Disabled)
   - **Implementation**: Full API + UI integration

### Remaining Planned Improvements

1. **Configurable Search Weights UI** (Medium Priority)
   - Add sliders for category/semantic/keyword weights
   - Show which categories matched the query
   - Display result diversity metrics

4. **Max References Configuration** (Completed ‚úì)
   - Users can now select 1-10 references per response
