## 🎯 How It Works

### Dual Search Methods
1. **🌿 Original (Semantic Search)**: Uses OpenAI embeddings for meaning-based search
2. **🔍 BM25 (Category-First Hybrid)**: Episode categorization table (80%) + semantic (15%) + keyword (5%) with cross-encoder reranking
3. **⚖️ Comparison Mode**: See both methods side-by-side to compare approaches

### Smart Recommendations
- **Inline Citations**: See which episodes and books Gaia referenced for each response
- **Cumulative References**: "Recommended Content" section shows ALL references from entire conversation
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Bottom section updates based on your conversation topics
- **Context Awareness**: "Based on our conversation about: permaculture, soil health..."
- **Related Suggestions**: "Try asking about: other episodes on composting"

### Custom Personalities
- Select from 3 pre-built personalities or create your own
- Custom prompts stored in browser localStorage
- Use any existing personality as a template for editing
- Works with both search methods

### 📝 User Feedback System
- **Quick Feedback**: Simple thumbs up/down buttons for each response
- **Detailed Feedback**: Optional detailed feedback with:
  - 5-star relevance rating
  - "Were the right episodes included?" checkbox
  - Free-text feedback area
- **Data Collection**: Feedback stored in JSON files for analysis
- **Persistent Storage**: Saved both locally and on server
- **Analysis Tools**: Script to view and analyze collected feedback

### 📚 Integrated Books
Currently includes three books by Aaron William Perry:
- **VIRIDITAS: THE GREAT HEALING** - Exploration of viriditas (life force) and regenerative practices
- **Soil Stewardship Handbook** - Practical guide for soil regeneration, composting, and biochar
- **Y on Earth: Get Smarter, Feel Better, Heal the Planet** - Sustainable living, mindfulness, and community connection

#### Book Integration Features
- **PDF Processing**: Automatically extracts and processes PDF books from `/data/books`
- **Chapter Detection**: Intelligent parsing of chapter boundaries and titles
- **Unified Search**: Books and podcast episodes searched together seamlessly
- **Enhanced Citations**: Shows book title, author, and chapter information with clickable links
- **Multiple Formats**: Links to eBook, audiobook, and print versions when available
- **Optimized Chunking**: Larger chunks for books (750 tokens) vs episodes (500 tokens)
